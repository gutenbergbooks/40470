<p class="center"><i>THE AUTHOR AND HIS WORK.</i></p>


<p>The Book of Job is the first great poem of the
soul in its mundane conflict, facing the inexorable
of sorrow, change, pain, and death, and feeling within
itself at one and the same time weakness and energy,
the hero and the serf, brilliant hopes, terrible fears.
With entire veracity and amazing force this book
represents the never-ending drama renewed in every
generation and every genuine life. It breaks upon us
out of the old world and dim muffled centuries with
all the vigour of the modern soul and that religious
impetuosity which none but Hebrews seem fully to
have known. Looking for precursors of Job we find a
seeming spiritual burden and intensity in the Accadian
psalms, their confessions and prayers; but if they
prepared the way for Hebrew psalmists and for the
author of Job, it was not by awaking the cardinal
thoughts that make this book what it is, nor by
supplying an example of the dramatic order, the fine
sincerity and abounding art we find here welling up
out of the desert. The Accadian psalms are fragments
of a polytheistic and ceremonial world; they spring
from the soil which Abraham abandoned that he might
found a race of strong men and strike out a new clear
way of life. Exhibiting the fear, superstition, and
ignorance of our race, they fall away from comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
with the marvellous later work and leave it unique
among the legacies of man's genius to man's need.
Before it a few notes of the awakening heart, athirst
for God, were struck in those Chaldæan entreaties, and
more finely in Hebrew psalm and oracle: but after it
have come in rich multiplying succession the Lamentations
of Jeremiah, Ecclesiastes, the Apocalypse, the
Confessions of Augustine, the Divina Commedia,
Hamlet, Paradise Regained, the Grace Abounding of
Bunyan, the Faust of Goethe and its progeny, Shelley's
poems of revolt and freedom, Sartor Resartus,
Browning's Easter Day and Rabbi Ben Ezra, Amiel's
Journal, with many other writings, down to "Mark
Rutherford" and the "Story of an African Farm."
The old tree has sent forth a hundred shoots, and
is still full of sap to our most modern sense. It is a
chief source of the world's penetrating and poignant
literature.</p>

<p>But there is another view of the book. It may well
be the despair of those who desire above all things to
separate letters from theology. The surpassing genius
of the writer is seen not in his fine calm of assurance
and self-possession, nor in the deft gathering and arranging
of beautiful images, but in his sense of elemental
realities and the daring with which he launches on a
painful conflict. He is convinced of Divine sovereignty,
and yet has to seek room for faith in a world shadowed
and confused. He is a prophet in quest of an oracle,
a poet, a maker, striving to find where and how the
man for whom he is concerned shall sustain himself.
And yet, with this paradox wrought into its very
substance, his work is richly fashioned, a type of the
highest literature, drawing upon every region natural
and supernatural, descending into the depths of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
woe, rising to the heights of the glory of God, never
for one moment insensible to the beauty and sublimity
of the universe. It is literature with which theology
is so blended that none can say, Here is one, there the
other. The passion of that race which gave the world
the idea of the soul, which clung with growing zeal to
the faith of the One Eternal God as the fountain of life
and equally of justice, this passion in one of its rarest
modes pours through the Book of Job like a torrent,
forcing its way towards the freedom of faith, the harmony
of intuition with the truth of things. The book
is all theology, one may say, and all humanity no less.
Singularly liberal in spirit and awake to the various
elements of our life, it is moulded, notwithstanding its
passion, by the artist's pleasure in perfecting form,
adding wealth of allusion and ornament to strength of
thought. The mind of the writer has not hastened.
He has taken long time to brood over his torment and
seek deliverance. The fire burns through the sculpture
and carved framework and painted windows of his art
with no loss of heat. Yet, as becomes a sacred book,
all is sobered and restrained to the rhythmic flow of
dramatic evolution, and it is as if the eager soul had
been chastened, even in its fieriest endeavour, by the
regular procession of nature, sunrise and sunset, spring
and harvest, and by the sense of the Eternal One, Lord
of light and darkness, life and death. Built where,
before it, building had never been reared in such firmness
of structure and glow of orderly art, with such
design to shelter the soul, the work is a fresh beginning
in theology as well as literature, and those who would
separate the two must show us how to separate them
here, must explain why their union in this poem is to
the present moment so richly fruitful. An origin it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
stands by reason of its subject no less than its power,
sincerity, and freedom.</p>

<p>A phenomenon in Hebrew thought and faith&mdash;to
what age does it belong? No record or reminiscence
of the author is left from which the least hint of time
may be gathered. He, who by his marvellous poem
struck a chord of thought deep and powerful enough to
vibrate still and stir the modern heart, is uncelebrated,
nameless. A traveller, a master of his country's
language, and versed no less in foreign learning, foremost
of the men of his day whensoever it was, he
passed away as a shadow, though he left an imperishable
monument. "Like a star of the first magnitude," says
Dr. Samuel Davidson, "the brilliant genius of the
writer of Job attracts the admiration of men as it
points to the Almighty Ruler chastening yet loving
His people. Of one whose sublime conceptions,
(mounting the height where Jehovah is enthroned in
light, inaccessible to mortal eye), lift him far above his
time and people&mdash;who climbs the ladder of the Eternal,
as if to open heaven&mdash;of this giant philosopher and
poet we long to know something, his habitation, name,
appearance. The very spot where his ashes rest we
desire to gaze upon. But in vain." Strange, do we
say? And yet how much of her great poet, Shakespeare,
does England know? It is not seldom the fate
of those whose genius lifts them highest to be unrecognised
by their own time. As English history tells
us more of Leicester than of Shakespeare, so Hebrew
history records by preference the deeds of its great
King Solomon. A greater than Solomon was in Israel,
and history knows him not. No prophet who followed
him and wrought sentences of his poem into lamentation
or oracle, no chronicler of the exile or the return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
preserving the names and lineage of the nobles of
Israel, has mentioned him. Literary distinction, the
praise of service to his country's faith could not have
been in his mind. They did not exist. He was content
to do his work, and leave it to the world and to God.</p>

<p>And yet the man lives in his poem. We begin to
hope that some indication of the period and circumstances
in which he wrote may be found when we
realise that here and there beneath the heat and
eloquence of his words may be heard those undertones
of personal desire and trust which once were the
solemn music of a life. His own, not his hero's, are
the philosophy of the book, the earnest search for God,
the sublime despondency, the bitter anguish, and the
prophetic cry that breaks through the darkness. We
can see that it is vain to go back to Mosaic or pre-Mosaic
times for life and thought and words like his;
at whatever time Job lived, the poet-biographer deals
with the perplexities of a more anxious world. In the
imaginative light with which he invests the past no
distinct landmarks of time are to be seen. The treatment
is large, general, as if the burden of his subject
carried the writer not only into the great spaces of
humanity, but into a region where the temporal faded
into insignificance as compared with the spiritual. And
yet, as through openings in a forest, we have glimpses
here and there, vaguely and momentarily showing what
age it was the author knew. The picture is mainly of
timeless patriarchal life; but, in the foreground or the
background, objects and events are sketched that help
our inquiry. "His troops come together and cast up
their way against me." "From out of the populous
city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth
out." "He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
their loins with a girdle; He leadeth priests away
spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.... He increaseth
the nations and destroyeth them; He spreadeth
the nations abroad and bringeth them in." No quiet
patriarchal life in a region sparsely peopled, where the
years went slow and placid, could have supplied these
elements of the picture. The writer has seen the woes
of the great city in which the tide of prosperity flows
over the crushed and dying. He has seen, and, indeed,
we are almost sure has suffered in, some national
disaster like those to which he refers. A Hebrew,
not of the age after the return from exile,&mdash;for the style
of his writing, partly through the use of Arabic and
Aramaic forms, has more of rude vigour and spontaneity
on the whole than fits so late a date,&mdash;he appears
to have felt all the sorrows of his people when the
conquering armies of Assyria or of Babylon overran
their land.</p>

<p>The scheme of the book helps to fix the time of the
composition. A drama so elaborate could not have
been produced until literature had become an art.
Such complexity of structure as we find in Psalm cxix.
shows that by the time of its composition much attention
was paid to form. It is no longer the pure lyric
cry of the unlearned singer, but the ode, extremely
artificial notwithstanding its sincerity. The comparatively
late date of the Book of Job appears in the orderly
balanced plan, not indeed so laboured as the psalm referred
to, but certainly belonging to a literary age.</p>

<p>Again, a note of time has been found by comparing
the contents of Job with Proverbs, Isaiah, Ecclesiastes,
and other books. Proverbs, chaps. iii. and viii., for example,
may be contrasted with chap. xxviii. of the Book
of Job. Placing them together we can hardly escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the conclusion that the one writer had been acquainted
with the work of the other. Now, in Proverbs it is
taken for granted that wisdom may easily be found:
"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man
that getteth understanding.... Keep sound wisdom
and discretion; so shall they be life unto thy soul and
grace to thy neck." The author of the panegyric has
no difficulty about the Divine rules of life. Again,
Proverbs viii. 15, 16: "By me kings reign, and princes
decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even
all the judges of the earth." In Job xxviii., however,
we find a different strain. There it is: "Where shall
wisdom be found?... It is hid from the eyes of all
living, and kept close from the fowls of the air;" and the
conclusion is that wisdom is with God, not with man.
Of the two it seems clear that the Book of Job is later.
It is occupied with questions which make wisdom, the
interpretation of providence and the ordering of life,
exceedingly hard. The writer of Job, with the passages
in Proverbs before him, appears to have said to himself:
Ah! it is easy to praise wisdom and advise men to
choose wisdom and walk in her ways. But to me the
secrets of existence are deep, the purposes of God
unfathomable. He is fain, therefore, to put into the
mouth of Job the sorrowful cry, "Where shall wisdom
be found, and where is the place of understanding?
Man knoweth not the price thereof.... It cannot be
gotten for gold." Both in Proverbs and Job, indeed,
the source of Hokhma or wisdom is ascribed to the
fear of Jehovah; but the whole contention in Job is
that man fails in the intellectual apprehension of the
ways of God. Referring the earlier portions of Proverbs
to the post-Solomonic age we should place the Book of
Job at a later date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not within our scope to consider here all the
questions raised by parallel passages and discuss the
priority and originality in each case. Some resemblances
in Isaiah may, however, be briefly noticed,
because we seem on the whole to be led to the conclusion
that the Book of Job was written between the
periods of the first and second series of Isaian oracles.
They are such as these. In Isaiah xix. 5, "The waters
shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted
and become dry,"&mdash;referring to the Nile: parallel in Job
xiv. 11, "As the waters fail from the sea, and the river
decayeth and drieth up,"&mdash;referring to the passing of
human life. In Isaiah xix. 13, "The princes of Zoan
are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived;
they have caused Egypt to go astray,"&mdash;an oracle of
specific application: parallel in Job xii. 24, "He taketh
away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth,
and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
is no way,"&mdash;a description at large. In Isaiah xxviii.
29, "This also cometh forth from Jehovah of Hosts,
which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom":
parallel in Job xi. 5, 6, "Oh that God would speak, and
open His lips against thee; and that He would show
thee the secrets of wisdom, that it is manifold in
effectual working!" The resemblance between various
parts of Job and "the writing of Hezekiah when he
had been sick and was recovered of his sickness," are
sufficiently obvious, but cannot be used in any argument
of time. And on the whole, so far, the generality and,
in the last case, somewhat stiff elaboration of the ideas
in Job as compared with Isaiah are almost positive
proof that Isaiah went first. Passing now to the
fortieth and subsequent chapters of Isaiah we find many
parallels and much general similarity to the contents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
our poem. In Job xxvi. 12, "He stirreth up the sea
with His power, and by His understanding He smiteth
through Rahab": parallel in Isaiah li. 9, 10, "Art thou
not it that cut Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon?
Art thou not it which dried up the sea, the waters
of the great deep?" In Job ix. 8, "Which alone
stretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
waves of the sea": parallel in Isaiah xl. 22, "That
stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth
them out as a tent to dwell in." In these and other
cases the resemblance is clear, and on the whole the
simplicity and apparent originality lie with the Book
of Job. Professor Davidson claims that Job, called
by God "My servant," resembles in many points the
servant of Jehovah in Isaiah liii., and the claim must be
admitted. But on what ground Kuenen can affirm that
the writer of Job had the second portion of Isaiah
before him and painted his hero from it one fails to see.
There are many obvious differences.</p>

<p>It has now become almost clear that the book
belongs either to the period (favoured by Ewald, Renan,
and others) immediately following the captivity of the
northern tribes, or to the time of the captivity of Judah
(fixed upon by Dr. A. B. Davidson, Professor Cheyne,
and others). We must still, however, seek further
light by glancing at the main problem of the book,
which is to reconcile the justice of Divine providence
with the sufferings of the good, so that man may
believe in God even in sorest affliction. We must also
consider the hint of time to be found in the importance
attached to personality, the feelings and destiny of the
individual and his claim on God.</p>

<p>Taking first the problem,&mdash;while it is stated in some
of the psalms and, indeed, is sure to have occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
many a sufferer, for most think themselves undeserving
of great pain and affliction,&mdash;the attempt to grapple with
it is first made in Job. The Proverbs, Deuteronomy,
and the historical books take for granted that prosperity
follows religion and obedience to God, and that suffering
is the punishment of disobedience. The prophets
also, though they have their own view of national
success, do not dispense with it as an evidence of
Divine favour. Cases no doubt were before the mind
of inspired writers which made any form of the theory
difficult to hold. But these were regarded as temporary
and exceptional, if indeed they could not be explained
by the rule that God sends earthly prosperity to the
good, and suffering to the bad in the long run. To
deny this and to seek another rule was the distinction
of the author of Job, his bold and original adventure in
theology. And the attempt was natural, one may say
necessary, at a time when the Hebrew states were
suffering from those shocks of foreign invasion which
threw their society, commerce, and politics into the
direst confusion. The old ideas of religion no longer
sufficed. Overcome in war, driven out of their own
land, they needed a faith which could sustain and cheer
them in poverty and dispersion. A generation having
no outlook beyond captivity was under a curse from
which penitence and renewed fidelity could not secure
deliverance. The assurance of God's friendship in
affliction had to be sought.</p>

<p>The importance attached to personality and the
destiny of the individual is on two sides a guide to the
date of the book. In some of the psalms, undoubtedly
belonging to an earlier period, the personal cry is
heard. No longer content to be part and parcel of the
class or nation, the soul in these psalms asserts its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
direct claim on God for light and comfort and help.
And some of them, the thirteenth for example, insist
passionately on the right of a believing man to a
portion in Jehovah. Now in the dispersion of the
northern tribes or the capture of Jerusalem this personal
question would be keenly accentuated. Amidst
the disasters of such a time those who are faithful
and pious suffer along with the rebellious and idolatrous.
Because they are faithful to God, virtuous and
patriotic beyond the rest, they may indeed have more
affliction and loss to endure. The psalmist among
his own people, oppressed and cruelly wronged, has
the need of a personal hope forced upon him, and
feels that he must be able to say, "The Lord is <i>my</i>
shepherd." Yet he cannot entirely separate himself
from his people. When those of his own house and
kindred rise against him, still they too may claim
Jehovah as their God. But the homeless exile, deprived
of all, a solitary wanderer on the face of the
earth, has need to seek more earnestly for the reason
of his state. The nation is broken up; and if he is to
find refuge in God, he must look for other hopes than
hinge on national recovery. It is the God of the whole
earth he must now seek as his portion. A unit not of
Israel but of humanity, he must find a bridge over the
deep chasm that seems to separate his feeble life from
the Almighty, a chasm all the deeper that he has been
plunged into sore trouble. He must find assurance
that the unit is not lost to God among the multitudes,
that the life broken and prostrate is neither forgotten
nor rejected by the Eternal King. And this precisely
corresponds with the temper of our book and the
conception of God we find in it. A man who has
known Jehovah as the God of Israel seeks his justification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
cries for his individual right to Eloah, the Most
High, the God of universal nature and humanity and
providence.</p>

<p>Now, it has been alleged that through the Book of
Job there runs a constant but covert reference to the
troubles of the Jewish Church in the Captivity, and
especially that Job himself represents the suffering
flock of God. It is not proposed to give up entirely
the individual problem, but along with that, superseding
that, the main question of the poem is held to be why
Judah should suffer so keenly and lie on the <i>mezbele</i> or
ash-heap of exile. With all respect to those who hold
this theory one must say that it has no substantial
support; and, on the other hand, it seems incredible
that a member of the Southern Kingdom (if the writer
belonged to it), expending so much care and genius on
the problem of his people's defeat and misery, should
have passed beyond his own kin for a hero, should
have set aside almost entirely the distinctive name
Jehovah, should have forgotten the ruined temple and
the desolate city to which every Jew looked back across
the desert with brimming eyes, should have let himself
appear, even while he sought to reassure his compatriots
in their faith, as one who set no store by their cherished
traditions, their great names, their religious institutions,
but as one whose faith was purely natural like that of
Edom. Among the good and true men who, at the
taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, were left in
penury, childless and desolate, a poet of Judah would
have found a Jewish hero. To his drama what embellishment
and pathos could have been added by genius like
our author's, if he had gone back on the terrible siege
and painted the Babylonian victors in their cruelty and
pride, the misery of the exiles in the land of idolatry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
One cannot help believing that to this writer Jerusalem
was nothing, that he had no interest in its temple,
no love for its ornate religious services and growing
exclusiveness. The suggestion of Ewald may be
accepted, that he was a member of the Northern
Kingdom driven from his home by the overthrow of
Samaria. Undeniable is the fact that his religion has
more sympathy with Teman than with Jerusalem as
it was. If he belonged to the north this seems to
be explained. To seek help from the priesthood and
worship of the temple did not occur to him. Israel
broken up, he has to begin afresh. For it is with his
own religious trouble he is occupied; and the problem
is universal.</p>

<p>Against the identification of Job with the servant of
Jehovah in Isaiah liii. there is one objection, and it is
fatal. The author of Job has no thought of the central
idea in that passage&mdash;vicarious suffering. New light
would have been thrown on the whole subject if one
of the friends had been made to suggest the possibility
that Job was suffering for others, that the "chastisement
of their peace" was laid on him. Had the author
lived after the return from captivity and heard of this
oracle, he would surely have wrought into his poem
the latest revelation of the Divine method in helping
and redeeming men.</p>

<p>The distinction of the Book of Job we have seen to
be that it offers a new beginning in theology. And it
does so not only because it shifts faith in the Divine
justice to a fresh basis, but also because it ventures
on a universalism for which indeed the Proverbs had
made way, which however stood in sharp contrast to
the narrowness of the old state religion. Already it
was admitted that others than Hebrews might love the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
truth, follow righteousness, and share the blessings of
the heavenly King. To that broader faith, enjoyed
by the thinkers and prophets of Israel, if not by the
priests and people, the author of the Book of Job
added the boldness of a more liberal inspiration. He
went beyond the Hebrew family for his hero to make
it clear that man, as man, is in direct relation to God.
The Psalms and the Book of Proverbs might be read
by Israelites and the belief still retained that God
would prosper Israel alone, at any rate in the end.
Now, the man of Uz, the Arabian sheikh, outside the
sacred fraternity of the tribes, is presented as a fearer
of the true God&mdash;His trusted witness and servant.
With the freedom of a prophet bringing a new message
of the brotherhood of men our author points us beyond
Israel to the desert oasis.</p>

<p>Yes: the creed of Hebraism had ceased to guide
thought and lead the soul to strength. The Hokhma
literature of Proverbs, which had become fashionable in
Solomon's time, possessed no dogmatic vigour, fell often
to the level of moral platitude, as the same kind of literature
does with us, and had little help for the soul. The
state religion, on the other hand, both in the Northern
and Southern Kingdoms, was ritualistic, again like ours,
clung to the old tribal notion, and busied itself about
the outward more than the inward, the sacrifices rather
than the heart, as Amos and Isaiah clearly indicate.
Hokhma of various kinds, plus energetic ritualism, was
falling into practical uselessness. Those who held the
religion as a venerable inheritance and national talisman
did not base their action and hope on it out in the
world. They were beginning to say, "Who knoweth
what is good for man in this life&mdash;all the days of his
vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? For who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"
A new theology was certainly needed for the crisis of
the time.</p>

<p>The author of the Book of Job found no school
possessed of the secret of strength. But he sought to
God, and inspiration came to him. He found himself in
the desert like Elijah, like others long afterwards, John
the Baptist, and especially Saul of Tarsus, whose words
we remember, "Neither went I up to Jerusalem, ... but
I went into Arabia." There he met with a religion
not confined by rigid ceremony as that of the southern
tribes, not idolatrous like that of the north, a religion
elementary indeed, but capable of development. And
he became its prophet. He would take the wide world
into council. He would hear Teman and Shuach and
Naamah; he would also hear the voice from the whirlwind,
and the swelling sea, and the troubled nations,
and the eager soul. It was a daring dash beyond the
ramparts. Orthodoxy might stand aghast within its
fortress. He might appear a renegade in seeking
tidings of God from the heathen, as one might now
who went from a Christian land to learn from the
Brahman and the Buddhist. But he would go nevertheless;
and it was his wisdom. He opened his mind
to the sight of fact, and reported what he found, so that
theology might be corrected and made again a handmaid
of faith. He is one of those Scripture writers
who vindicate the universality of the Bible, who show
it to be a unique foundation, and forbid the theory of
a closed record or dried-up spring, which is the error
of Bibliolatry. He is a man of his age and of the world,
yet in fellowship with the Eternal Mind.</p>

<p>An exile, let us suppose, of the Northern Kingdom,
escaping with his life from the sword of the Assyrian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the author of our book has taken his way into the
Arabian wilderness and there found the friendship of
some chief and a safe retreat among his people. The
desert has become familiar to him, the sandy wastes
and vivid oases, the fierce storms and affluent sunshine,
the animal and vegetable life, the patriarchal customs
and legends of old times. He has travelled through
Idumæa, and seen the desert tombs, on to Midian and
its lonely peaks. He has heard the roll of the Great
Sea on the sands of the Shefelah, and seen the vast
tide of the Nile flowing through the verdure of the
Delta and past the pyramids of Memphis. He has
wandered through the cities of Egypt and viewed their
teeming life, turning to the use of imagination and
religion all he beheld. With a relish for his own language,
yet enriching it by the words and ideas of other
lands, he has practised himself in the writer's art, and
at length, in some hour of burning memory and revived
experience, he has caught at the history of one who,
yonder in a valley of the eastern wilderness, knew the
shocks of time and pain though his heart was right
with God; and in the heat of his spirit the poet-exile
makes the story of that life into a drama of the trial of
human faith,&mdash;his own endurance and vindication, his
own sorrow and hope.</p>

<p>The land of Uz appears to have been a general
name for the great Syro-Arabian desert. It is
described vaguely as lying "east of Palestine and
north of Edom," or as "corresponding to the <i>Arabia
Deserta</i> of classical geography, at all events so much
of it as lies north of the 30th parallel of latitude." In
Jer. xxv. 20, among those to whom the wine-cup of
fury is sent, are mentioned "all the mingled people and
all the kings of the land of Uz." But within this wide
region, extending from Damascus to Arabia, from
Palestine to Chaldæa, it seems possible to find a more
definite locality for the dwelling-place of Job. Eliphaz,
one of his friends, belonged to Teman, a district or city
of Idumæa. In Lam. iv. 21, the writer, who may have
had the Book of Job before him, says, "Rejoice and
be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
land of Uz"; a passage that seems to indicate a
habitable region, not remote from the gorges of Idumæa.
It is necessary also to fix on a district which lay in
the way of the caravans of Sheba and Tema, and was
exposed to the attacks of lawless bands of Chaldæans
and Sabeans. At the same time there must have been
a considerable population, abundant pasturage for large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
flocks of camels and sheep, and extensive tracts of
arable land. Then, the dwelling of Job lay near a city
at the gate of which he sat with other elders to administer
justice. The attention paid to details by the author
of the book warrants us in expecting that all these
conditions may be satisfied.</p>

<p>A tradition which places the home of Job in the
Hauran, the land of Bashan of Scripture, some score
of miles from the Sea of Galilee, has been accepted by
Delitzsch. A monastery, there, appears to have been
regarded from early Christian times as authentically
connected with the name of Job. But the tradition has
little value in itself, and the locality scarcely agrees in
a single particular with the various indications found
in the course of the book. The Hauran does not belong
to the land of Uz. It was included in the territory
of Israel. Nor can it by any stretch of imagination
be supposed to lie in the way of wandering bands of
Sabeans, whose home was in the centre of Arabia.</p>

<p>But the conditions are met&mdash;one has no hesitation
in saying, fully met&mdash;in a region hitherto unidentified
with the dwelling-place of Job, the valley or oasis of
Jauf (Palgrave, <i>Djowf</i>), lying in the North Arabian desert
about two hundred miles almost due east from the
modern Maan and the ruins of Petra. Various interesting
particulars regarding this valley and its inhabitants
are given by Mr. C. M. Doughty in his "Travels
in Arabia Deserta." But the best description is that
by Mr. Palgrave, who, under the guidance of Bedawin,
visited the district in 1862. Travelling from Maan by
way of the Wadi Sirhan, after a difficult and dangerous
journey of thirteen days, their track in the last stage
following "endless windings among low hills and stony
ledges," brought them to greener slopes and traces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
tillage, and at length "entered a long and narrow pass,
whose precipitous banks shut in the view on either
side." After an hour of tedious marching in terrible
heat, turning a huge pile of crags, they looked down
into the Jauf.</p>

<p>"A broad, deep valley, descending ledge after ledge
till its innermost depths are hidden from sight amid
far-reaching shelves of reddish rock, below everywhere
studded with tufts of palm groves and clustering fruit
trees in dark green patches, down to the farthest end
of its windings; a large brown mass of irregular
masonry crowning a central hill; beyond, a tall and
solitary tower overlooking the opposite bank of the
hollow, and farther down, small round turrets and
flat house-roofs, half buried amid the garden foliage,
the whole plunged in a perpendicular flood of light
and heat; such was the first aspect of the Djowf as
we now approached it from the west." The principal
town bears the name of the district, and is composed
of eight villages, once distinct, which have in process
of time coalesced into one. The principal quarter
includes the castle, and numbers about four hundred
houses. "The province is a large oval depression, of
sixty or seventy miles long by ten or twelve broad,
lying between the northern desert that separates it
from Syria and Euphrates, and the southern Nefood,
or sandy waste." Its fertility is great and is aided
by irrigation, so that the dates and other fruits produced
in the Jauf are famed throughout Arabia. The
people "occupy a half-way position between Bedouins
and the inhabitants of the cultivated districts." Their
number is reckoned at about forty thousand, and there
can be no question that the valley has been a seat of
population from remote antiquity. To the other points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of identification may be added this, that in the Wadi
Sirhan, not far from the entrance to the Jauf, Mr.
Palgrave passed a poor settlement with the name
Oweysit, or Owsit, which at least suggests the εν χὡρα τη Αυσἱτιδι
of the Septuagint, and the Outz, or
Uz, of our text. With population, an ancient city,
fertile fields and ample pasturage in the middle of the
desert, the nearest habitable region to Edom, in the
way of caravans, generally safe from predatory tribes,
yet exposed to those from the east and south that
might make long expeditions under pressure of great
need, the valley of the Jauf appears to correspond in
every important particular with the dwelling-place of
the man of Uz.</p>

<p>The question whether such a man as Job ever lived
has been variously answered, one Hebrew rabbi, for
example, affirming that he was a mere parable. But
Ezekiel names him along with Noah and Daniel, James
in his epistle says, "Ye have heard of the patience
of Job"; and the opening words of this book, "There
was a man in the land of Uz," are distinctly historical.
To know, therefore, that a region in the Arabian desert
corresponds so closely with the scene of Job's life is
to be reassured that a true history forms the basis of
the poem. The tradition with which the author began
his work probably supplied the name and dwelling-place
of Job, his wealth, piety, and afflictions, including
the visit of his friends, and his restoration after sore
trial from the very gate of despair to faith and prosperity.
The rest comes from the genius of the author
of the drama. This is a work of imagination based on
fact. And we do not proceed far till we find, first
ideal touches, then bold flights into a region never
opened to the gaze of mortal eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Job is described in the third verse as one of the Children
of the East or Bene-Kedem, a vague expression denoting
the settled inhabitants of the North Arabian desert, in
contrast to the wandering Bedawin and the Sabeans of
the South. In Genesis and Judges they are mentioned
along with the Amalekites, to whom they were akin.
But the name as used by the Hebrews probably covered
the inhabitants of a large district very little known.
Of the Bene-Kedem Job is described as the greatest.
His riches meant power, and in the course of the frequent
alternations of life in those regions one who had
enjoyed unbroken prosperity for many years would be
regarded with veneration not only for his wealth, but
for what it signified&mdash;the constant favour of Heaven.
He had his settlement near the city, and was the
acknowledged emeer of the valley, taking his place at
the gate as chief judge. How great a chief one might
become who added to his flocks and herds year by
year and managed his affairs with prudence we learn
from the history of Abraham; and to the present day,
where the patriarchal mode of living and customs
continue, as among the Kurds of the Persian highland,
examples of wealth in sheep and oxen, camels and
asses almost approaching that of Job are sometimes to
be met with. The numbers&mdash;seven thousand sheep,
three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five
hundred she-asses&mdash;are probably intended simply to
represent his greatness. Yet they are not beyond the
range of possibility.</p>

<p>The family of Job&mdash;his wife, seven sons, and three
daughters&mdash;are about him when the story begins,
sharing his prosperity. In perfect friendliness and
idyllic joy the brothers and sisters spend their lives,
the shield of their father's care and religion defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
them. Each of the sons has a day on which he
entertains the others, and at the close of the circle of
festivities, whether weekly or once a year, there is a
family sacrifice. The father is solicitous lest his children,
speaking or even thinking irreverently, may have dishonoured
God. For this reason he makes the periodic
offering, from time to time keeping on behalf of his
household a day of atonement. The number of the
children is not necessarily ideal, nor is the round of
festivals and sacred observances. Yet the whole picture
of happy family life and unbroken joy begins to lift the
narrative into an imaginative light. So fine a union of
youthful enjoyment and fatherly sympathy and puritanism
is seldom approached in this world. The poet has
kept out of his picture the shadows which must have
lurked beneath the sunny surface of life. It is not
even suggested that the recurring sacrifices were required.
Job's thoughtfulness is precautionary: "It may
be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in
their hearts." The children are dear to him, so dear
that he would have nothing come between them and
the light of heaven.</p>

<p>For the religion of Job, sincere and deep, disclosing
itself in these offerings to the Most High, is, above his
fatherly affection and sympathy, the distinction with
which the poet shows him invested. He is a fearer of
the One Living and True God, the Supremely Holy.
In the course of the drama the speeches of Job often
go back on his faithfulness to the Most High; and we
can see that he served his fellow-men justly and generously
because he believed in a Just and Generous God.
Around him were worshippers of the sun and moon,
whose adoration he had been invited to share. But he
never joined in it, even by kissing his hand when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
splendid lights of heaven moved with seeming Divine
majesty across the sky. For him there was but One
God, unseen yet ever present, to whom, as the Giver of
all, he did not fail to offer thanksgiving and prayer with
deepening faith. In his worship of this God the old
order of sacrifice had its place, simple, unceremonious.
Head of the clan, he was the priest by natural right,
and offered sheep or bullock that there might be atonement,
or maintenance of fellowship with the Friendly
Power who ruled the world. His religion may be called
a nature religion of the finest type&mdash;reverence, faith,
love, freedom. There is no formal doctrine beyond
what is implied in the names Eloah, the Lofty One,
Shaddai, Almighty, and in those simple customs of
prayer, confession, and sacrifice in which all believers
agreed. Of the law of Moses, the promises to Abraham,
and those prophetical revelations by which the covenant
of God was assured to the Hebrew people Job knows
nothing. His is a real religion, capable of sustaining
the soul of man in righteousness, a religion that can
save; but it is a religion learned from the voices of
earth and sky and sea, and from human experience
through the inspiration of the devout obedient heart.
The author makes no attempt to reproduce the beliefs
of patriarchal times as described in Genesis, but with
a sincere and sympathetic touch he shows what a fearer
of God in the Arabian desert might be. Job is such a
man as he may have personally known.</p>

<p>In the region of Idumæa the faith of the Most High
was held in remarkable purity by learned men, who
formed a religious caste or school of wide reputation;
and Teman, the home of Eliphaz, appears to have been
the centre of the cultus. "Is wisdom no more in
Teman?" cries Jeremiah. "Is counsel perished from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the prudent? Is their wisdom (hokhma) vanished?"
And Obadiah makes a similar reference: "Shall I
not in that day, saith the Lord, destroy the wise men
out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount
of Esau?" In Isaiah the darkened wisdom of some
time of trouble and perplexity is reflected in the
"burden of Dumah," that is, Idumæa: "One calleth
unto me out of Seir," as if with the hope of clearer
light on Divine providence, "Watchman, what of the
night? Watchman, what of the night?" And the
answer is an oracle in irony, almost enigma: "The
morning cometh, and also the night. If ye will inquire,
inquire; turn, come." Not for those who dwelt in
shadowed Dumah was the clear light of Hebrew prophecy.
But the wisdom or hokhma of Edom and its
understanding were nevertheless of the kind in Proverbs
and elsewhere constantly associated with true religion
and represented as almost identical with it. And we
may feel assured that when the Book of Job was written
there was good ground for ascribing to sages of Teman
and Uz an elevated faith.</p>

<p>For a Hebrew like the author of Job to lay aside for
a time the thought of his country's traditions, the law
and the prophets, the covenant of Sinai, the sanctuary,
and the altar of witness, and return in writing his
poem to the primitive faith which his forefathers
grasped when they renounced the idolatry of Chaldæa
was after all no grave abandonment of privilege. The
beliefs of Teman, sincerely held, were better than the
degenerate religion of Israel against which Amos testified.
Had not that prophet even pointed the way
when he cried in Jehovah's name&mdash;"Seek not Bethel,
nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba....
Seek Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and
maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the
waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face
of the earth; Jehovah is His name"? Israel after
apostasy may have needed to begin afresh, and to
seek on the basis of the primal faith a new atonement
with the Almighty. At all events there were many
around, not less the subjects of God and beloved by
Him, who stood in doubt amidst the troubles of life
and the ruin of earthly hopes. Teman and Uz were
in the dominion of the heavenly King. To correct
and confirm their faith would be to help the faith of
Israel also and give the true religion of God fresh
power against idolatry and superstition.</p>

<p>The book which returned thus to the religion of
Teman found an honourable place in the roll of sacred
Scriptures. Although the canon was fixed by Hebrews
at a time when the narrowness of the post-exilic age
drew toward Pharisaism, and the law and the temple
were regarded with veneration far greater than in the
time of Solomon, room was made for this book of broad
human sympathy and free faith. It is a mark at once
of the wisdom of the earlier rabbis and their judgment
regarding the essentials of religion. To Israel, as St.
Paul afterwards said, belonged "the adoption, and the
glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law,
and the service of God, and the promises." But he too
shows the same disposition as the author of our poem
to return on the primitive and fundamental&mdash;the justification
of Abraham by his faith, the promise made to
him, and the covenant that extended to his family:
"They which be of faith, the same are sons of
Abraham"; "They which be of faith are blessed with
the faithful Abraham"; "Not through the law was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
promise to Abraham or to his seed"; "That the blessing
of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Jesus Christ." A greater than St. Paul has shown us
how to use the Old Testament, and we have perhaps
misunderstood the intent with which our Lord carried
the minds of men back to Abraham and Moses and the
prophets. He gave a religion to the whole world.
Was it not then the spiritual dignity, the religious
breadth of the Israelite fathers, their sublime certainty
of God, their glow and largeness of faith for which
Christ went back to them? Did He not for these find
them preparers of His own way?</p>

<p>From the religion of Job we pass to consider his
character described in the words, "That man was perfect
and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed
evil." The use of four strong expressions, cumulatively
forming a picture of the highest possible worth and
piety, must be held to point to an ideal life. The
epithet <i>perfect</i> is applied to Noah, and once and again
in the Psalms to the disposition of the good. Generally,
however, it refers rather to the scheme or plan by which
conduct is ordered than to the fulfilment in actual life;
and a suggestive parallel may be found in the "perfection"
or "entire sanctification" of modern dogma.
The word means <i>complete</i>, built up all round so that no
gaps are to be seen in the character. We are asked to
think of Job as a man whose uprightness, goodness,
and fidelity towards man were unimpeachable, who
was also towards God reverent, obedient, grateful,
wearing his religion as a white garment of unsullied
virtue. Then is it meant that he had no infirmity of
will or soul, that in him for once humanity stood
absolutely free from defect? Scarcely. The perfect
man in this sense, with all moral excellences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
without weakness, would as little have served the
purpose of the writer as one marred by any gross or
deforming fault. The course of the poem shows that
Job was not free from errors of temper and infirmities
of will. He who is proverbially known as the most
patient failed in patience when the bitter cup of
reproach had to be drained. But undoubtedly the
writer exalts the virtue of his hero to the highest
range, a plane above the actual. In order to set the
problem of the book in a clear light such purity of
soul and earnest dutifulness had to be assumed as
would by every reckoning deserve the rewards of God,
the "Well done, good and faithful servant; enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord."</p>

<p>The years of Job have passed hitherto in unbroken
prosperity. He has long enjoyed the bounty of providence,
his children about him, his increasing flocks of
sheep and camels, oxen and asses feeding in abundant
pastures. The stroke of bereavement has not fallen
since his father and mother died in ripe old age. The
dreadful simoom has spared his flocks, the wandering
Bedawin have passed them by. An honoured chief, he
rules in wisdom and righteousness, ever mindful of the
Divine hand by which he is blessed, earning for himself
the trust of the poor and the gratitude of the afflicted.
Enjoying unbounded respect in his own country, he is
known beyond the desert to a circle of friends who
admire him as a man and honour him as a servant of
God. His steps are washed with butter, and the rock
pours him out rivers of oil. The lamp of God shines
upon his head, and by His light he walks through
darkness. His root is spread out to the waters, and
the dew lies all night upon his branch.</p>

<p>Now let us judge this life from a point of view which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the writer may have taken, which at any rate it becomes
us to take, with our knowledge of what gives manhood
its true dignity and perfectness. Obedience to God,
self-control and self-culture, the observance of religious
forms, brotherliness and compassion, uprightness and
purity of life, these are Job's excellences. But all
circumstances are favourable, his wealth makes beneficence
easy and moves him to gratitude. His natural
disposition is towards piety and generosity; it is pure
joy to him to honour God and help his fellow-men. The
life is beautiful. But imagine it as the unclouded experience
of years in a world where so many are tried
with suffering and bereavement, foiled in their strenuous
toil and disappointed in their dearest hopes, and is
it not evident that Job's would tend to become a
kind of dream-life, not deep and strong, but on the
surface, a broad stream, clear, glittering with the reflection
of moon and stars or of the blue heaven, but
shallow, gathering no force, scarcely moving towards
the ocean? When a Psalmist says, "Thou hast set our
iniquities before Thee, our secret sins in the light of
Thy countenance. For all our days are passed away
in Thy wrath: we bring our years to an end as a tale
that is told," he depicts the common experience of men,
a sad experience, yet needful to the highest wisdom
and the noblest faith. No dreaming is there when the
soul is met with sore rebuffs and made aware of the
profound abyss that lies beneath, when the limbs fail
on the steep hills of difficult duty. But a long succession
of prosperous years, immunity from disappointment,
loss, and sorrow, lulls the spirit to repose.
Earnestness of heart is not called for, and the will,
however good, is never braced to endurance. Whether
by subtle intention or by an instinctive sense of fitness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the writer has painted Job as one who with all his
virtue and perfectness spent his life as in a dream and
needed to be awakened. He is a Pygmalion's statue of
flawless marble, the face divinely calm and not without
a trace of self-conscious remoteness from the suffering
multitudes, needing the hot blast of misfortune to bring
it to life. Or, let us say, he is a new type of humanity
in paradise, an Adam enjoying a Garden of Eden fenced
in from every storm, as yet undiscovered by the enemy.
We are to see the problem of the primitive story of
Genesis revived and wrought out afresh, not on the old
lines, but in a way that makes it real to the race of
suffering men. The dream-life of Job in his time of
prosperity corresponds closely with that ignorance of
good and evil which the first pair had in the garden
eastward in Eden while as yet the forbidden tree bore
its fruit untouched, undesired, in the midst of the
greenery and flowers.</p>

<p>When did the man Job live? Far back in the
patriarchal age, or but a short time before the author
of the book came upon his story and made it immortal?
We may incline to the later date, but it is of no importance.
For us the interest of the book is not antiquarian
but humane, the relation of pain and affliction to the
character of man, the righteous government of God.
The life and experiences of Job are idealised so that
the question may be clearly understood; and the writer
makes not the slightest attempt to give his book the
colour of remote antiquity.</p>

<p>But we cannot fail to be struck from the outset with
the genius shown in the choice of a life set in the
Arabian desert. For breadth of treatment, for picturesque
and poetic effect, for the development of a drama
that was to exhibit the individual soul in its need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
God, in the shadow of deep trouble as well as the sunshine
of success, the scenery is strikingly adapted, far
better than if it had been laid in some village of Israel.
Inspiration guided the writer's choice. The desert
alone gave scope for those splendid pictures of nature,
those noble visions of Divine Almightiness, and those
sudden and tremendous changes which make the movement
impressive and sublime.</p>

<p>The modern analogue in literature is the philosophic
novel. But Job is far more intense, more operatic,
as Ewald says, and the elements are even simpler.
Isolation is secured. Life is bared to its elements.
The personality is entangled in disaster with the least
possible machinery or incident. The dramatising altogether
is singularly abstract. And thus we are enabled
to see, as it were, the very thought of the author, lonely,
resolute, appealing, under the widespread Arabian sky
and the Divine infinitude.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE OPENING SCENE IN HEAVEN.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Chap.</span> i. 6-12.</p>


<p>With the presentation of the scene in heaven,
the genius, the pious daring, and fine moral
insight of the writer at once appear&mdash;in one word, his
inspiration. From the first we feel a sure yet deeply
reverent touch, a spirit composed in its high resolve.
The thinking is keen, but entirely without strain. In
no mere flash did the over-world disclose itself and
those decrees that shape man's destiny. There is
constructive imagination. Wherever the idea of the
heavenly council was found, whether in the vision
Micaiah narrated to Jehoshaphat and Ahab, or in the
great vision of Isaiah, it certainly was not unsought.
Through the author's own study and art the inspiration
came that made the picture what it is. The calm
sovereignty of God, not tyrannical but most sympathetic,
is presented with simple felicity. It was the
distinction of Hebrew prophets to speak of the Almighty
with a confidence which bordered on familiarity yet
never lost the grace of profound reverence; and here
we find that trait of serious naïveté. The writer
ventures on the scene he paints with no consciousness
of daring nor the least air of difficult endeavour, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
quietly, as one who has the thought of the Divine
government of human affairs constantly before his
mind and glories in the majestic wisdom of God and
His friendliness to men. In a single touch the King
is shown, and before Him the hierarchies and powers
of the invisible world in their responsibility to His rule.
Centuries of religious culture are behind the words,
and also many years of private meditation and philosophic
thought. To this man, because he gave himself
to the highest discipline, revelations came, uplifting,
broad, and deep.</p>

<p>In contrast to the Almighty we have the figure of
the Adversary, or Satan, depicted with sufficient clearness,
notably coherent, representing a phase of being
not imaginary but actual. He is not, as the Satan of
later times came to be, the head of a kingdom peopled
with evil spirits, a nether world separated from the abode
of the heavenly angels by a broad, impassable gulf.
He has no distinctive hideousness, nor is he painted as
in any sense independent, although the evil bent of his
nature is made plain, and he ventures to dispute the
judgment of the Most High. This conception of the
Adversary need not be set in opposition to those which
afterwards appear in Scripture as if truth must lie
entirely there or here. But we cannot help contrasting
the Satan of the Book of Job with the grotesque,
gigantic, awful, or despicable fallen angels of the world's
poetry. Not that the mark of genius is wanting in
these; but they reflect the powers of this world and
the accompaniments of malignant human despotism.
The author of Job, on the contrary, moved little by
earthly state and grandeur, whether good or evil, solely
occupied with the Divine sovereignty, never dreams
of one who could maintain the slightest shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
authority in opposition to God. He cannot trifle with
his idea of the Almighty in the way of representing a
rival to Him; nor can he degrade a subject so serious
as that of human faith and well-being by painting with
any touch of levity a superhuman adversary of men.</p>

<p>Dante in his <i>Inferno</i> attempts the portraiture of the
monarch of hell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"That emperor who sways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The realm of sorrow, at mid-breast from the ice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To scowl upon his Maker, well from him<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The enormous size of this figure is matched by its
hideousness; the misery of the arch-fiend, for all its
horror, is grotesque:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"At six eyes he wept; the tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown three faces rolled in bloody foam."<br /></span>

<p>Passing to Milton, we find sublimity in his pictures
of the fallen legions, and it culminates in the vision of
their king:&mdash;</p>

<p>The picture is magnificent. It has, however, little
justification from Scripture. Even in the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Revelation we see a kind of contempt of the Adversary
where an angel from heaven with a great chain in his
hand lays hold on the dragon, that old serpent which is
the devil, and Satan, and binds him a thousand years.
Milton has painted his Satan largely, as not altogether
unfit to take arms against the Omnipotent, grown
gigantic, even sublime, in the course of much theological
speculation that had its source far back in
Chaldæan and Iranian myths. Perhaps, too, the
sympathies of the poet, playing about the fortunes
of fallen royalty, may have unconsciously coloured the
vision which he saw and drew with such marvellous
power, dipping his pencil "in the hues of earthquake
and eclipse."</p>

<p>This splendid regal arch-fiend has no kinship with
the Satan of the Book of Job; and, on the other hand,
the Mephistopheles of the "Faust," although bearing
an outward resemblance to him, is, for a quite different
reason, essentially unlike. Obviously Goethe's picture
of a cynical devil gaily perverting and damning a
human mind is based on the Book of Job. The
"Prologue in Heaven," in which he first appears, is
an imitation of the passage before us. But while the
vulgarity and insolence of Mephistopheles are in contrast
to the demeanour of the Adversary in presence
of Jehovah, the real distinction lies in the kind of
power ascribed to the one and the other. Mephistopheles
is a cunning tempter. He receives permission
to mislead if he can, and not only places his victim in
circumstances fitted to ruin his virtue, but plies him
with arguments intended to prove that evil is good,
that to be pure is to be a fool. No such power of evil
suggestion is given to the Adversary of Job. His
action extends only to the outward events by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the trial of faith is brought about. Cynical he is and
bent on working evil, but not by low cunning and
sophistry. He has no access to the mind. While it
cannot be said that Goethe has descended beneath the
level of possibility, since a contemporary and friend of
his own, Schopenhauer, might almost have sat for the
portrait of Mephistopheles, the realism in Job befits
the age of the writer and the serious purpose he had
in view. Faust is a work of genius and art, and
succeeds in its degree. The author of Job succeeds
in a far higher sense, by the charm of simple sincerity
and the strength of Divine inspiration, keeping the play
of supernatural agency beyond human vision, making
the Satan a mere instrument of the Divine purpose, in
no sense free or intellectually powerful.</p>

<p>The scene opens with a gathering of the "sons of
the Elohim" in presence of their King. Professor
Cheyne thinks that these are "supernatural Titanic
beings who had once been at strife with Jehovah, but
who now at stated times paid him their enforced
homage"; and this he illustrates by reference to
Chap. xxi. 22 and Chap. xxv. 2. But the question in
the one passage, "Shall any teach God knowledge?
seeing He judgeth those that are high" &#1512;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;, the heights
of heaven, highnesses], and the affirmation in the other,
"He maketh peace in His high places," can scarcely be
held to prove the supposition. The ordinary view that
they are heavenly powers or angels, willing servants
not unwilling vassals of Jehovah, is probably correct.
They have come together at an appointed time to give
account of their doings and to receive commands, and
among them the Satan or Adversary presents himself,
one distinguished from all the rest by the name he
bears and the character and function it implies. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
is no hint that he is out of place, that he has impudently
forced his way into the audience chamber.
Rather does it appear that he, like the rest, has to give
his account. The question "Whence comest thou?"
expresses no rebuke. It is addressed to the Satan as
to the others. We see, therefore, that this "Adversary,"
to whomsoever he is opposed, is not a being excluded
from communication with God, engaged in a princely
revolt. When the reply is put into his mouth that he
has been "going to and fro in the earth, and pacing up
and down in it," the impression conveyed is that a
certain task of observing men, perhaps watching for
their misdeeds, has been assumed by him. He appears
a spirit of restless and acute inquiry into men's lives
and motives, with a keen eye for the weaknesses of
humanity and a fancy quick to imagine evil.</p>

<p>Evidently we have here a personification of the
doubting, misbelieving, misreading spirit which, in our
day, we limit to men and call pessimism. Now Koheleth
gives so finished an expression to this temper that
we can hardly be wrong in going back some distance of
time for its growth; and the state of Israel before the
northern captivity was a soil in which every kind of
bitter seed might spring up. The author of Job may
well have drawn from more than one cynic of his day
when he set his mocking figure in the blaze of the
celestial court. Satan is the pessimist. He exists, so
far as his intent goes, to find cause against man, and
therefore, in effect, against God, as man's Creator. A
shrewd thinker is this Adversary, but narrowed to one
line and that singularly like some modern criticism of
religion, the resemblance holding in this that neither
shows any feeling of responsibility. The Satan sneers
away faith and virtue; the modern countenances both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and so has an excellent reason for pronouncing them
hollow; or he avoids both, and is sure there is nothing
but emptiness where he has not sought. Either way,
all is <i>hab&#275;l habalim</i>&mdash;vanity of vanities. And yet
Satan is so held and governed by the Almighty that
he can only strike where permission is given. Evil,
as represented by him, is under the control of Divine
wisdom and goodness. He appears as one to whom
the words of Christ "Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve," would bring
home a sense neither of duty nor privilege, but of a
sheer necessity, to be contested to the last. Nevertheless
he is a vassal of the Almighty. Here the
touch of the author is firm and true.</p>

<p>So of pessimistic research and philosophy now.
We have writers who follow humanity in all its base
movements and know nothing of its highest. The
research of Schopenhauer and even the psychology of
certain modern novelists are mischievous, depraving,
for this reason, if no other, that they evaporate
the ideal. They promote generally that diseased
egotism to which judgment and aspiration are alike
unknown. Yet this spirit too serves where it has no
dream of serving. It provokes a healthy opposition,
shows a hell from which men recoil, and creates so
deadly ennui that the least gleam of faith becomes
acceptable, and even Theosophy, because it speaks of
life, secures the craving mind. Moreover, the pessimist
keeps the church a little humble, somewhat awake to
the error that may underlie its own glory and the meanness
that mingles too often with its piety. A result of
the freedom of the human mind to question and deny,
pessimism has its place in the scheme of things.
Hostile and often railing, it is detestable enough, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
needs not alarm those who know that God takes care
of His world.</p>

<p>The challenge which begins the action of the drama&mdash;by
whom is it thrown out? By the Almighty. God
sets before the Satan a good life: "Hast thou considered
My servant Job? that there is none like him
in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that
feareth God, and escheweth evil." The source of the
whole movement, then, is a defiance of unbelief by the
Divine Friend of men and Lord of all. There is such
a thing as human virtue, and it is the glory of God to
be served by it, to have His power and divinity reflected
in man's spiritual vigour and holiness.</p>

<p>Why does the Almighty throw out the challenge and
not wait for Satan's charge? Simply because the trial
of virtue must begin with God. This is the first step
in a series of providential dealings fraught with the
most important results, and there is singular wisdom
in attributing it to God. Divine grace is to be seen
thrusting back the chaotic falsehoods that darken the
world of thought. They exist; they are known to
Him who rules; and He does not leave humanity to
contend with them unaided. In their keenest trials
the faithful are supported by His hand, assured of
victory while they fight His battles. Ignorant pride,
like that of the Adversary, is not slow to enter into
debate even with the All-wise. Satan has the question
ready which implies a lie, for his is the voice of that
scepticism which knows no reverence. But the entire
action of the book is in the line of establishing faith
and hope. The Adversary is challenged to do his
worst; and man, as God's champion, will have to do
his best,&mdash;the world and angels looking on.</p>

<p>And this thought of a Divine purpose to confound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the falsehoods of scepticism answers another inquiry
which may readily occur. From the first the Almighty
knows and asserts the virtue of His servant,&mdash;that he
is one who fears God and eschews evil. But why, then,
does He condescend to ask of Satan, "Hast thou considered
My servant Job?" Since He has already
searched the heart of Job and found it faithful, He does
not need for His own satisfaction to hear Satan's
opinion. Nor are we to suppose that the expression
of this Adversary's doubt can have any real importance.
But if we take the Satan as representing all those who
depreciate faith and undermine virtue, the challenge is
explained. Satan is of no account in himself. He will
go on cavilling and suspecting. But for the sake of
the race of men, its emancipation from the miserable
suspicions that prey on the heart, the question is
proposed. The drama has its prophetical design; it
embodies a revelation; and in this lies the value of all
that is represented. Satan, we shall find, disappears,
and thereafter the human reason is alone addressed,
solely considered. We pass from scene to scene, from
controversy to controversy, and the great problem of
man's virtue, which also involves the honour of God
Himself, is wrought out that our despondency and fear
may be cured; that we may never say with Koheleth,
"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</p>

<p>To the question of the Almighty, Satan replies by
another: "Doth Job fear God for nought?" With a
certain air of fairness he points to the extraordinary
felicity enjoyed by the man. "Hast Thou not made an
hedge about him, and about his house, and about all
that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the
work of his hands, and his substance is increased in
the land." It is a thought naturally arising in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
mind that very prosperous people have all on the side
of their virtue, and may be less pure and faithful than
they seem. Satan adopts this thought, which is not
only blameless, but suggested by what we see of God's
government. He is base and captious in using it, and
turns it with a sneer. Yet on the surface he only hints
that God should employ His own test, and so vindicate
His action in making this man so prosperous. For why
should Job show anything but gratitude towards God
when all is done for him that heart can desire? The
favourites of kings, indeed, who are loaded with titles
and wealth, sometimes despise their benefactors, and,
being raised to high places, grow ambitious of one
still higher, that of royalty itself. The pampered
servant becomes an arrogant rival, a leader of revolt.
Thus too great bounty is often met with ingratitude.
It does not, however, suit the Adversary to suggest
that pride and rebellion of this kind have begun to
show themselves in Job, or will show themselves. He
has no ground for such an accusation, no hope of
proving it true. He confines himself, therefore, to a
simpler charge, and in making it implies that he is only
judging this man on general principles and pointing
to what is sure to happen in the case. Yes; he knows
men. They are selfish at bottom. Their religion is
selfishness. The blameless human fear is that much
may be due to favourable position. The Satan is sure
that all is due to it.</p>

<p>Now, the singular thing here is the fact that the
Adversary's accusation turns on Job's enjoyment of that
outward felicity which the Hebrews were constantly
desiring and hoping for as a reward of obedience to
God. The writer comes thus at once to show the peril
of the belief which had corrupted the popular religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of his time, which may even have been his own error
once, that abundant harvests, safety from enemies,
freedom from pestilence, such material prosperity as
many in Israel had before the great disasters, were to
be regarded as the evidence of accepted piety. Now
that the crash has fallen and the tribes are scattered,
those left in Palestine and those carried into exile alike
sunk in poverty and trouble, the author is pointing out
what he himself has come to see, that Israel's conception
of religion had hitherto admitted and may even
have gendered a terrible mistake. Piety might be largely
selfishness&mdash;was often mingled with it. The message
of the author to his countrymen and to the world is
that a nobler mind must replace the old desire for
happiness and plenty, a better faith the old trust that
God would fill the hands that served Him well. He
teaches that, whatever may come, though trouble after
trouble may fall, the great true Friend is to be adored
for what He is, obeyed and loved though the way lies
through storm and gloom.</p>

<p>Striking is the thought that, while the prophets Amos
and Hosea were fiercely or plaintively assailing the
luxury of Israel and the lives of the nobles, among
those very men who excited their holy wrath may have
been the author of the Book of Job. Dr. Robertson
Smith has shown that from the "gala days" of
Jeroboam II. to the fall of Samaria there were only
some thirty years. One who wrote after the Captivity
as an old man may therefore have been in the flush
of youth when Amos prophesied, may have been one
of the rich Israelites who lay upon beds of ivory and
stretched themselves upon their couches, and ate lambs
out of the flock and calves out of the midst of the stall,
for whose gain the peasant and the slave were oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
by stewards and officers. He may have been one of
those on whom the blindness of prosperity had fallen
so that the storm-cloud from the east with its vivid
lightning was not seen, who held it their safety to
bring sacrifices every morning and tithes every three
days, to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which
was leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings and
publish them (Amos iv. 4, 5). The mere possibility
that the author of Job may have had this very time of
prosperity and religious security in his own past and
heard Hosea's trumpet blast of doom is very suggestive,
for if so he has learned how grandly right the
prophets were as messengers of God. By the way of
personal sorrow and disaster he has passed to the
better faith he urges on the world. He sees what even
the prophets did not fully comprehend, that desolation
might be gain, that in the most sterile wilderness
of life the purest light of religion might shine on
the soul, while the tongue was parched with fatal thirst
and the eye glazed with the film of death. The
prophets looked always beyond the shadows of disaster
to a new and better day when the return of a penitent
people to Jehovah should be followed by a restoration
of the blessings they had forfeited&mdash;fruitful fields and
vineyards, busy and populous cities, a general distribution
of comfort if not of wealth. Even Amos and
Hosea had no clear vision of the prophetic hope the
first exile was to yield out of its darkness to Israel and
the world.</p>

<p>The question, then, "Doth Job fear God for nought?"
sending a flash of penetrating light back on Israel's
history, and especially on the glowing pictures of prosperity
in Solomon's time, compelling all to look to the
foundation and motives of their faith, marks a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
important era in Hebrew thought. It is, we may say,
the first note of a piercing strain which thrills on to the
present time. Taking rise here, the spirit of inquiry
and self-examination has already sifted religious belief
and separated much of the chaff from the wheat. Yet
not all. The comfort and hope of believers are not
yet lifted above the reach of Satan's javelin. While
salvation is thought of mainly as self-enjoyment, can
we say that the purity of religion is assured? When
happiness is promised as the result of faith, whether
happiness now, or hereafter in heavenly glory, the whole
fabric of religion is built on a foundation insecure,
because it may be apart from truth, holiness, and virtue.
It does not avail to say that holiness is happiness,
and so introduce personal craving under cover of the
finest spiritual idea. To grant that happiness is in any
sense the distinctive issue of faith and faithfulness, to
keep happiness in view in submitting to the restraints
and bearing the burdens of religion, is to build the
highest and best on the shifting sand of personal taste and
craving. Make happiness that for which the believer
is to endure and strive, allow the sense of personal
comfort and immunity from change to enter into his
picture of the reward he may expect, and the question
returns, Doth this man serve God for nought? Life
is not happiness, and the gift of God is everlasting
life. Only when we keep to this supreme word in the
teaching of Christ, and seek the fulness and liberty and
purity of life, apart from that happiness which is at
bottom the satisfaction of predominant desires, shall
we escape from the constantly recurring doubt that
threatens to undermine and destroy our faith.</p>

<p>If we look further, we find that the very error which
has so long impoverished religion prevails in philanthropy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and politics, prevails there at the present time
to an alarming extent. The favourite aim of social
meliorists is to secure happiness for all. While life
is the main thing, everywhere and always, strength
and breadth and nobleness of life, their dream is to
make the warfare and service of man upon the earth
so easy that he shall have no need for earnest personal
endeavour. He is to serve for happiness, and have no
service to do that may even in the time of his probation
interfere with happiness. The pity bestowed on those
who toil and endure in great cities and on bleak hillsides
is that they fail of happiness. Persons who have no
conception that vigour and endurance are spiritually
profitable, and others who once knew but have forgotten
the benefits of vigour and the gains of endurance, would
undo the very order and discipline of God. Are human
beings to be encouraged to seek happiness, taught to
doubt God because they have little pleasure, given
to understand that those who enjoy have the best of
the universe, and that they must be lifted up to this
level or lose all? Then the sweeping condemnation
will hang over the world that it is following a new
god and has said farewell to the stern Lord of
Providence.</p>

<p>Much may be justly said in condemnation of the
jealous, critical spirit of the Adversary. Yet it remains
true that his criticism expresses what would be a fair
charge against men who passed this stage of existence
without full trial. And the Almighty is represented as
confirming this when He puts Job into the hands of
Satan. He has challenged the Adversary, opening the
question of man's fidelity and sincerity. He knows
what will result. It is not the will of some eternal
Satan that is the motive, but the will of God. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Adversary's scornful question is woven into God's wise
ordinance, and made to subserve a purpose which
completely transcends the base hope involved in it.
The life of Job has not yet had the difficult and
strenuous probation necessary to assured faith, or
rather to the consciousness of a faith immovably rooted
in God. It would be utterly inconsistent with the
Divine wisdom to suppose God led on and beguiled by
the sneer of His own creature to do what was needless
or unfair, or indeed in any sense opposed to His own
plan for His creation. And we shall find that throughout
the book it is assumed by Job, implied by the
author, that what is done is really the doing of God
Himself. The Satan of this Divine poem remains
altogether subsidiary as an agent. He may propose,
but God disposes. He may pride himself on the keenness
of his intellect; but wisdom, compared to which
his subtlety is mere blundering, orders the movement
of events for good and holy ends.</p>

<p>The Adversary makes his proposal: "Put forth
now Thine hand, and touch all that he hath, and he
will bid Thee farewell." He does not propose to make
use of sensual temptation. The only method of trial
he ventures to suggest is deprivation of the prosperity
for which he believes Job has served God. He takes
on him to indicate what the Almighty may do, acknowledging
that the Divine power, and not his, must bring
into Job's life those losses and troubles that are to test
his faith.</p>

<p>After all some may ask, Is not Satan endeavouring
to tempt the Almighty? And if it were true that the
prosperous condition of Job, or any man, implies God's
entire satisfaction with his faith and dutifulness and
with his character as a man, if, further, it must be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
as true that sorrow and loss are evil, then this proposal
of the Satan is a temptation. It is not so in reality,
for "God cannot be tempted to evil." No creature
could approach His holiness with a temptation. But
Satan's intention is to move God. He considers
success and happiness to be intrinsically good, and
poverty and bereavement to be intrinsically evil. That
is to say, we have here the spirit of unfaith endeavouring
to destroy God as well as man. For the sake of
truth professedly, for his own pride of will really,
he would arrest the righteousness and grace of the
Divine. He would unmake God and orphan man.
The scheme is futile of course. God can allow his
proposal, and be no less the Infinitely generous, wise,
and true. The Satan shall have his desire; but not a
shadow shall fall on the ineffable glory.</p>

<p>At this point, however, we must pause. The question
that has just arisen can only be answered after a
survey of human life in its relation to God, and especially
after an examination of the meaning of the term
<i>evil</i> as applied to our experiences. We have certain
clear principles to begin with: that "God cannot be
tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man";
that all God does must show not less beneficence, not
less love, but more as the days go by. These principles
will have to be vindicated when we proceed to
consider the losses, what may be called the disasters
that follow each other in quick succession and threaten
to crush the life they try.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, casting a glance at those happy dwellings
in the land of Uz, we see all going on as before, no
mind darkened by the shadow that is gathering, or in
the least aware of the controversy in heaven so full
of moment to the family circle. The pathetic ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the blessed ignorance in which a man may live hangs
upon the picture. The cheerful bustle of the homestead
goes on, the feasts and sacrifices, diligent labour
rewarded with the produce of fields, the wine and oil
of vineyards and olive gardens, fleeces of the flock
and milk of the kine.</p>

<p>Coming now to the sudden and terrible changes
which are to prove the faithfulness of the servant
of God, we must not fail to observe that in the
development of the drama the trial of Job personally
is the sole consideration. No account is taken of the
character of those who, being connected with his fortunes
and happiness, are now to be swept away that he may
suffer. To trace their history and vindicate Divine
righteousness in reference to each of them is not
within the scope of the poem. A typical man is taken
as hero, and we may say the discussion covers the
fate of all who suffer, although attention is fixed on
him alone.</p>

<p>The writer is dealing with a story of patriarchal
life, and himself is touched with the Semitic way of
thinking. A certain disregard of the subordinate human
characters must not be reckoned strange. His thoughts,
far-reaching as they are, run in a channel very different
from ours. The world of his book is that of family
and clan ideas. The author saw more than any man
of his time; but he could not see all that engages
modern speculation. Besides, the glory of God is the
dominant idea of the poem; not men's right to joy, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
peace, or even life; but God's right to be wholly Himself
and greatly true. In the light of this high thought
we must be content to have the story of one soul
traced with such fulness as might be compassed, the
others left practically untouched. If the sufferings of
the man whom God approves can be explained in
harmony with the glory of Divine justice, then the
sudden calamities that fall upon his servants and
children will also be explained. For, although death
is in a sense an ultimate thing, and loss and affliction,
however great, do not mean so much as death; yet,
on the other hand, to die is the common lot, and the
quick stroke appears merciful in comparison with Job's
dreadful experiences. Those who are killed by lightning
or by the sword do but swiftly and without protracted
pain fall into the hands of God. We need not
conclude that the writer means us to regard the sons
and daughters of Job and his servants as mere chattels,
like the camels and sheep, although the people of the
desert would have so regarded them. But the main
question presses; the range of the discussion must
be limited; and the tradition which forms the basis
of the poem is followed by the author whenever it
supplies the elements of his inquiry.</p>

<p>We have entirely refused the supposition that the
Almighty forgot His righteousness and grace in putting
the wealth and happiness of Job into the hands of
Satan. The trials we now see falling one after the
other are not sent because the Adversary has suggested
them, but because it is right and wise, for the glory
of God and for the perfecting of faith, that Job should
suffer them. What is God's doing is not in this case
nor in any case evil. He cannot wrong His servant
that glory may come to Himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>And just here arises a problem which enters into
all religious thought, the wrong solution of which
depraves many a philosophy, while the right understanding
of it sheds a flood of light on our life in this
world. A thousand tongues, Christian, non-Christian,
and neo-Christian, affirm that life is for enjoyment.
What gives enjoyment is declared to be good, what
gives most enjoyment is reckoned best, and all that
makes for pain and suffering is held to be evil. It
is allowed that pain endured now may bring pleasure
hereafter, and that for the sake of future gain a little
discomfort may be chosen. But it is evil nevertheless.
One doing his best for men would be expected to give
them happiness at once and, throughout life, as much
of it as possible. If he inflicted pain in order to
enhance pleasure by and by, he would have to do so
within the strictest limits. Whatever reduces the
strength of the body, the capacity of the body for enjoyment
and the delight of the mind accompanying the
body's vigour, is declared bad, and to do anything which
has this effect is to do evil or wrong. Such is the
ethic of the philosophy finally and powerfully stated
by Mr. Spencer. It has penetrated as widely as he
could wish; it underlies volumes of Christian sermons
and semi-Christian schemes. If it be true, then the
Almighty of the Book of Job, bringing affliction, sorrow,
and pain upon His servant, is a cruel enemy of man,
to be hated, not revered. This matter needs to be considered
at some length.</p>

<p>The notion that pain is evil, that he who suffers
is placed at moral disadvantage, appears very plainly
in the old belief that those conditions and surroundings
of our life which minister to enjoyment are the proofs
of the goodness of God on which reliance must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
placed so far as nature and providence testify of Him.
Pain and sorrow, it was held, need to be accounted for
by human sin or otherwise; but we know that God
is good because there is enjoyment in the life He
gives. Paley, for example, says that the proof of the
Divine <i>goodness</i> rests upon contrivances everywhere
to be seen for the purpose of giving us pleasure. He
tells us that, when God created the human species,
"either He wished them happiness, or He wished them
misery, or He was indifferent and unconcerned about
either"; and he goes on to prove that it must be
our happiness He desired, for, otherwise, wishing our
misery, "He might have made everything we tasted,
bitter; everything we saw, loathsome; everything we
touched, a sting; every smell, a stench; and every
sound, a discord:" while, if He had been indifferent
about our happiness we must impute all enjoyment
we have "to our good fortune," that is, to bare chance,
an impossible supposition. Paley's further survey of life
leads to the conclusion that God has it as His chief
aim to make His creatures happy and, in the circumstances,
does the best He can for them, better far than
they are commonly disposed to think. The agreement
of this position with that of Spencer lies in the presupposition
that goodness can be proved only by arrangements
for giving pleasure. If God is good for this
reason, what follows when He appoints pain, especially
pain that brings no enjoyment in the long run? Either
He is not altogether "good" or He is not all-powerful.</p>

<p>The author of the Book of Job does not enter into
the problem of pain and affliction with the same
deliberate attempt to exhaust the subject as Paley has
made; but he has the problem before him. And in
considering the trial of Job as an example of the suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and sorrow of man in this world of change, we find
a strong ray of light thrown upon the darkness. The
picture is a Rembrandt; and where the radiance falls
all is sharp and bright. But the shadows are deep;
and we must seek, if possible, to make out what lies in
those shadows. We shall not understand the Book of
Job, nor form a just opinion of the author's inspiration,
nor shall we understand the Bible as a whole, unless
we reach a point of view clear of the mistakes that
stultify the reasoning of Paley and plunge the mind of
Spencer, who refuses to be called a materialist, into the
utter darkness of materialism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, as to enjoyment, we have the capacity for it,
and it flows to us from many external objects as well
as from the operation of our own minds and the putting
forth of energy. It is in the scheme of things ordained
by God that His creatures shall enjoy. On the other
hand, trouble, sorrow, loss, bodily and mental pain, are
also in the scheme of things. They are provided for in
numberless ways&mdash;in the play of natural forces causing
injuries, dangers from which we cannot escape; in the
limitations of our power; in the antagonisms and disappointments
of existence; in disease and death. They
are provided for by the very laws that bring pleasure,
made inevitable under the same Divine ordinance.
Some say it detracts from the goodness of God to
admit that as He appoints means of enjoyment so He
also provides for pain and sorrow and makes these
inseparable from life. And this opinion runs into the
extreme dogmatic assertion that "good," by which we
are to understand <i>happiness</i>,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Many hold this to be necessary to the vindication of
God's goodness. But the source of the whole confusion
lies here, that we prejudge the question by calling pain
evil. The light-giving truth for modern perplexity is
that pain and loss are not <i>evil</i>, are in no sense <i>evil</i>.</p>

<p>Because we desire happiness and dislike pain, we
must not conclude that pain is bad and that, when
any one suffers, it is because he or another has done
wrong. There is the mistake that vitiates theological
thought, making men run to the extreme either of
denying God altogether because there is suffering in
the world, or of framing a rose-water eschatology.
Pain is one thing, moral evil is quite another thing.
He who suffers is not necessarily a wrong-doer; and
when, through the laws of nature, God inflicts pain,
there is no evil nor anything approaching wrong. In
Scripture, indeed, pain and evil are apparently identified.
"Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and
shall we not receive evil?" "Is there evil in the city,
and the Lord hath not done it?" "Thus saith the
Lord, Behold I will bring upon Judah, and upon all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil that I have
pronounced against them." In these and many other
passages the very thing seems to be meant which has
just been denied, for evil and suffering appear to be
made identical. But human language is not a perfect
instrument of thought, any more than thought is a
perfect channel of truth. One word has to do duty in
different senses. Moral evil, wrongness, on the one
hand; bodily pain, the misery of loss and defeat, on
the other hand&mdash;both are represented by one Hebrew
word [&#1512;&#1463;&#1506;&mdash;root meaning, <i>displeased</i>]. In the following
passages, where moral evil is clearly meant, it occurs
just as in those previously quoted: "Wash you, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
you clean, cease to do evil, learn to do well"; "The
face of the Lord is against them that do evil." The
different meanings which one Hebrew word may bear
are not generally confused in translation. In this case,
however, the confusion has entered into the most
modern language. From a highly esteemed thinker the
following sentence may be quoted by way of example:
"The other religions did not feel evil like Israel; it did
not stand in such complete antagonism to their idea of
the Supreme, the Creator and Sovereign of man, nor
in such absolute contradiction to their notion of what
ought to be; and so they either reconciled themselves
as best they could to the evil that was necessary, or
invented means by which men could escape from it
by escaping from existence." The singular misapprehension
of Divine providence which underlies a statement
like this can only be got rid of by recognising
that enjoyment and suffering are not the good and evil
of life, that both of them stand quite apart from what
is intrinsically good and bad in a moral sense, and that
they are simply means to an end in the providence of
God.</p>

<p>It is not difficult, of course, to see how the idea of
pain and the idea of moral evil have been linked together.
It is by the thought that suffering is punishment
for evil done; and that the suffering is therefore
itself evil. Pain was simply penalty inflicted by an
offended heavenly power. The evil of a man's doings
came back to him, made itself felt in his suffering.
This was the explanation of all that was unpleasant,
disastrous and vexing in the lot of man. He would
enjoy always, it was conceived, if wrong-doing or
failure in duty to the higher powers did not kindle
divine anger against him. True, the wrong-doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
might not be his own. The son might suffer for
the parent's fault. Iniquity might be remembered to
children's children and fall terribly on those who had
not themselves transgressed. The fates pursued the
descendants of an impious man. But wrong done
somewhere, rebellion of some one against a divinity,
was always the antecedent of pain and sorrow and
disaster. And as the other religions thought, so, in this
matter, did that of Israel. To the Hebrew the deep
conviction of this, as Dr. Fairbairn has said, made
poverty and disease peculiarly abhorrent. In Psalm
lxxxix. the prosperity of David is depicted, and
Jehovah speaks of the covenant that must be kept:
"If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my
judgments; ... then will I visit their transgression
with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes." The
trouble has fallen, and out of the depth of it, attributing
to past sin all defeat and disaster from which the people
suffer&mdash;the breaking down of the hedges, curtailment
of the vigour of youth, overthrow in war&mdash;the psalmist
cries, "How long, O Lord, wilt Thou hide Thyself for
ever? How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire?
O remember how short my time is: for what vanity
hast Thou created all the children of men?" There is
here no thought that anything painful or afflictive could
manifest the fatherhood of God; it must proceed from
His anger, and force the mind back upon the memory of
sin, some transgression that has caused the Almighty
to suspend His kindness for a time.</p>

<p>Here it was the author of Job found the thought of
his people. With this he had to harmonise the other
beliefs&mdash;peculiarly theirs&mdash;that the lovingkindness of
the Lord is over all His works, that God who is
supremely good cannot inflict moral injury on any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
His covenanted servants. And the difficulty he felt
survives. The questions are still urged: Is not pain
bound up with wrong-doing? Is not suffering the
mark of God's displeasure? Are they not evil, therefore?
And, on the other hand, Is not enjoyment
appointed to him who does right? Does not the whole
scheme of Divine providence, as the Bible sets it forth,
including the prospect it opens into the eternal future,
associate happiness with well-doing and pain with evil-doing?
We desire enjoyment, and cannot help desiring
it. We dislike pain, disease, and all that limits our
capacity for pleasure. Is it not in accordance with this
that Christ appears as the Giver of light and peace
and joy to the race of men?</p>

<p>These questions look difficult enough. Let us attempt
to answer them.</p>

<p>Pleasure and pain, happiness and suffering, are
elements of creaturely experience appointed by God.
The right use of them makes life, the wrong use of
them mars it. They are ordained, all of them in
equal degree, to a good end; for all that God does is
done in perfect love as well as in perfect justice. It is
no more wonderful that a good man should suffer than
that a bad man should suffer; for the good man, the
man who believes in God and therefore in goodness,
making a right use of suffering, will gain by it in the
true sense; he will reach a deeper and nobler life. It
is no more wonderful that a bad man, one who disbelieves
in God and therefore in goodness, should be
happy than that a good man should be happy, the
happiness being God's appointed means for both to
reach a higher life. The main element of this higher
life is vigour, but not of the body. The Divine purpose
is <i>spiritual</i> evolution. That gratification of the sensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
side of our nature for which physical health and a
well-knit organism are indispensable&mdash;paramount in
the pleasure-philosophy&mdash;is not neglected, but is made
subordinate in the Divine culture of life. The grace of
God aims at the life of the spirit&mdash;power to love, to
follow righteousness, to dare for justice' sake, to seek
and grasp the true, to sympathise with men and bear
with them, to bless them that curse, to suffer and be
strong. To promote this vitality all God appoints is
fitted&mdash;pain as well as pleasure, adversity as well as
prosperity, sorrow as well as joy, defeat as well as
success. We wonder that suffering is so often the
result of imprudence. On the ordinary theory the fact
is inexplicable, for imprudence has no dark colour of
ethical faultiness. He who by an error of judgment
plunges himself and his family into what appears
irretrievable disaster, may, by all reckoning, be almost
blameless in character. If suffering is held to be penal,
no reference to the general sin of humanity will account
for the result. But the reason is plain. The suffering
is disciplinary. The nobler life at which Divine providence
aims must be sagacious no less than pure, guided
by sound reason no less than right feeling.</p>

<p>And if it is asked how from this point of view we
are to find the punishment of sin, the answer is that
happiness as well as suffering is punishment to him
whose sin and the unbelief that accompanies it pervert
his view of truth, and blind him to the spiritual life
and the will of God. The pleasures of a wrong-doer
who persistently denies obligation to Divine authority
and refuses obedience to the Divine law are no gain,
but loss. They dissipate and attenuate his life. His
sensuous or sensual enjoyment, his delight in selfish
triumph and gratified ambition are real, give at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
time quite as much happiness as the good man has in
his obedience and virtue, perhaps a great deal more.
But they are penal and retributive nevertheless; and
the conviction that they are so becomes clear to the
man whenever the light of truth is flashed upon his
spiritual state. We read Dante's pictures of the Inferno,
and shudder at the dreadful scenes with which he has
filled the descending circles of woe. He has omitted
one that would have been the most striking of all,&mdash;unless
indeed an approach to it is to be found in the
episode of Paolo and Francesca,&mdash;the picture of souls
self-doomed to seek happiness and to enjoy, on whose
life the keen light of eternity shines, revealing the
gradual wasting away of existence, the certain degeneration
to which they are condemned.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the pains and disasters which
fall to the lot of evil men, intended for their correction,
if in perversity or in blindness they are misunderstood,
again become punishment; for they, too, dissipate and
attenuate life. The real good of existence slips away
while the mind is intent on the mere pain or vexation
and how it is to be got rid of. In Job we find a
purpose to reconcile affliction with the just government
of God. The troubles into which the believing man is
brought urge him to think more deeply than he has
ever thought, become the means of that intellectual and
moral education which lies in discovery of the will and
character of God. They also bring him by this way
into deeper humility, a fine tenderness of spiritual
nature, a most needful kinship with his fellows. See
then the use of suffering. The impenitent, unbelieving
man has no such gains. He is absorbed in the distressing
experience, and that absorption narrows and
debases the activity of the soul. The treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
this matter here is necessarily brief. It is hoped, however,
that the principle has been made clear.</p>

<p>Does it require any adaptation or under-reading of
the language of Scripture to prove the harmony of its
teaching with the view just given of happiness and
suffering as related to punishment? Throughout the
greater part of the Old Testament the doctrine of
suffering is that old doctrine which the author of
Job found perplexing. Not infrequently in the New
Testament there is a certain formal return to it; for
even under the light of revelation the meaning of
Divine providence is learnt slowly. But the emphasis
rests on <i>life</i> rather than happiness, and on <i>death</i> rather
than suffering in the gospels; and the whole teaching
of Christ, pointed to the truth. This world and
our discipline here, the trials of men, the doctrine
of the cross, the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ,
are not fitted to introduce us into a state of existence
in which mere enjoyment, the gratification of personal
tastes and desires, shall be the main experience. They
are fitted to educate the spiritual nature for life, fulness
of life. Immortality becomes credible when it is seen
as progress in vigour, progress towards that profound
compassion, that fidelity, that unquenchable devotion
to the glory of God the Father which marked the life
of the Divine Son in this world.</p>

<p>Observe, it is not denied that joy is and will be
desired, that suffering and pain are and will remain
experiences from which human nature must recoil.
The desire and the aversion are wrought into our
constitution; and just because we feel them our whole
mortal discipline has its value. In the experience of
them lies the condition of progress. On the one hand
pain urges, on the other joy attracts. It is in the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of desire for joy of a finer and higher kind that civilisation
realises itself, and even religion lays hold of us
and lures us on. But the conditions of progress are
not to be mistaken for the end of it. Joy assumes
sorrow as a possibility. Pleasure can only exist as
alternative to the experience of pain. And the life
that expands and reaches finer power and exaltation
in the course of this struggle is the main thing. The
struggle ceases to be acute in the higher ranges of life;
it becomes massive, sustained, and is carried on in the
perfect peace of the soul. Therefore the future state
of the redeemed is a state of blessedness. But the
blessedness accompanying the life is not the glory.
The glory of the perfected is life itself. The heaven of
the redeemed appears a region of existence in which
the exaltation, enlargement, and deepening of life shall
constantly and consciously go on. Conversely the hell
of evil-doers will not be simply the pain, the suffering,
the defeat to which they have doomed themselves, but the
constant attenuation of their life, the miserable wasting
of which they shall be aware, though they find some pitiful
pleasure, as Milton imagined his evil angels finding
theirs, in futile schemes of revenge against the Highest.</p>

<p>Pain is not in itself an evil. But our nature recoils
from suffering and seeks life in brightness and power,
beyond the keen pangs of mortal existence. The
creation hopes that itself "shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption." The finer life is, the more
sensible it must be of association with a body doomed
to decay, the more sensible also of that gross human
injustice and wrong which dare to pervert God's
ordinance of pain and His sacrament of death, usurping
His holy prerogative for the most unholy ends.
And so we are brought to the Cross of Christ. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
He "bore our sins in His own body to the tree," when
He "suffered for sins once, the Righteous for the
unrighteous," the sacrifice was real, awful, immeasurably
profound. Yet, could death be in any sense
degrading or debasing to Him? Could evil touch His
soul? Over its most insolent assumption of the right
to injure and destroy He stood, spiritually victorious in
the presence of His enemies, and rose, untouched in soul,
when His body was broken on the cross. His sacrifice
was great because He bore the sins of men and died as
God's atonement. His sublime devotion to the Father
whose holy law was trampled under foot, His horror
and endurance of human iniquity which culminated in
His death, made the experience profoundly terrible.
Thus the spiritual dignity and power He gained provided
new life for the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now possible to understand the trials of Job.
So far as the sufferer is concerned, they are no less
beneficent than His joys; for they provide that necessary
element of probation by which life of a deeper
and stronger kind is to be reached, the opportunity
of becoming, as a man and a servant of the Almighty,
what he had never been, what otherwise he could not
become. The purpose of God is entirely good; but it
will remain with the sufferer himself to enter by the
fiery way into full spiritual vigour. He will have the
protection and grace of the Divine Spirit in his time of
sore bewilderment and anguish. Yet his own faith
must be vindicated while the shadow of God's hand
rests upon his life.</p>

<p>And now the forces of nature and the wild tribes
of the desert gather about the happy settlement of the
man of Uz. With dramatic suddenness and cumulative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
terror stroke after stroke descends. Job is seen before
the door of his dwelling. The morning broke calm and
cloudless, the bright sunshine of Arabia filling with
brilliant colour the far horizon. The day has been
peaceful, gracious, another of God's gifts. Perhaps, in
the early hours, the father, as priest of his family,
offered the burnt-offerings of atonement lest his sons
should have renounced God in their hearts; and now,
in the evening, he is sitting calm and glad, hearing the
appeals of those who need his help and dispensing alms
with a generous hand. But one comes in haste, breathless
with running, scarcely able to tell his tale. Out
in the fields the oxen were ploughing and the asses
feeding. Suddenly a great band of Sabeans fell upon
them, swept them away, slew the servants with the
edge of the sword: this man alone has escaped with
his life. Rapidly has he spoken; and before he has
done another appears, a shepherd from the more distant
pastures, to announce a second calamity. "The fire of
God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep,
and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
escaped to tell thee." They scarcely dare to look on
the face of Job, and he has no time to speak, for here is
a third messenger, a camel-driver, swarthy and naked to
the loins, crying wildly as he runs, The Chaldæans made
three bands&mdash;fell upon the camels&mdash;swept them away&mdash;the
servants are slain&mdash;I only am left. Nor is this the
last. A fourth, with every mark of horror in his face,
comes slowly and brings the most terrible message of all.
The sons and daughters of Job were feasting in their
eldest brother's house; there came a great wind from
the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house,
and it fell. The young men and women are all dead.
One only has escaped, he who tells the dreadful tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain idealism appears in the causes of the
different calamities and their simultaneous, or almost
simultaneous, occurrence. Nothing, indeed, is assumed
which is not possible in the north of Arabia. A raid
from the south, of Sabeans, the lawless part of a nation
otherwise engaged in traffic; an organised attack by
Chaldæans from the east, again the lawless fringe of
the population of the Euphrates valley, those who, inhabiting
the margin of the desert, had taken to desert
ways; then, of natural causes, the lightning or the
fearful hot wind which coming suddenly stifles and
kills, and the whirlwind, possible enough after a thunderstorm
or simoom,&mdash;all of these belong to the region in
which Job lived. But the grouping of the disasters
and the invariable escape of one only from each belong
to the dramatic setting, and are intended to have a
cumulative effect. A sense of the mysterious is produced,
of supernatural power, discharging bolt after
bolt in some inscrutable mood of antagonism. Job is
a mark for the arrows of the Unseen. And when the
last messenger has spoken, we turn in dismay and pity
to look on the rich man made poor, the proud and
happy father made childless, the fearer of God on
whom the enemy seems to have wrought his will.</p>

<p>In the stately Oriental way, as a man who bows to
fate or the irresistible will of the Most High, Job seeks
to realise his sudden and awful deprivations. We
watch him with silent awe as first he rends his mantle,
the acknowledged sign of mourning and of the disorganisation
of life, then shaves his head, renouncing
in his grief even the natural ornament of the hair, that
the sense of loss and resignation may be indicated.
This done, in deep humiliation he bows and falls prone
on the earth and worships, the fit words falling in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
kind of solemn chant from his lips: "Naked came I
forth from my mother's womb, and naked I return
thereto. Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away.
Let Jehovah's name be blessed." The silence of grief
and of death has fallen about him. No more shall be
heard the bustle of the homestead to which, when the
evening shadows were about to fall, a constant stream
of servants and laden oxen used to come, where the
noise of cattle and asses and the shouts of camel-drivers
made the music of prosperity. His wife and
the few who remain, with bowed heads, dumb and
aimless, stand around. Swiftly the sun goes down, and
darkness falls upon the desolate dwelling.</p>

<p>Losses like these are apt to leave men distracted.
When everything is swept away, with the riches those
who were to inherit them, when a man is left, as Job
says, naked, bereft of all that labour had won and the
bounty of God had given, expressions of despair do not
surprise us, nor even wild accusations of the Most High.
But the faith of this sufferer does not yield. He is
resigned, submissive. The strong trust that has grown
in the course of a religious life withstands the shock,
and carries the soul through the crisis. Neither did
Job accuse God nor did he sin, though his grief was great.
So far he is master of his soul, unbroken though desolated.
The first great round of trial has left the man a
believer still.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE DILEMMA OF FAITH.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Chap.</span> ii.</p>


<p>As the drama proceeds to unfold the conflict between
Divine grace in the human soul and those chaotic
influences which hold the mind in doubt or drag it back
into denial, Job becomes a type of the righteous
sufferer, the servant of God in the hot furnace of affliction.
All true poetry runs thus into the typical. The
interest of the movement depends on the representative
character of the life, passionate in jealousy, indignation,
grief, or ambition, pressing on exultantly to unheard-of
success, borne down into the deepest circles of woe.
Here it is not simply a man's constancy that has to be
established, but God's truth against the Adversary's
lie, the "everlasting yea" against the negations that
make all life and virtue seem the mere blossoming of
dust. Job has to pass through profoundest trouble,
that the drama may exhaust the possibilities of doubt,
and lead the faith of man towards liberty.</p>

<p>Yet the typical is based on the real; and the conflict
here described has gone on first in the experience of
the author. Not from the outside, but from his own
life has he painted the sorrows and struggles of a soul
urged to the brink of that precipice beyond which lies
the blank darkness of the abyss. There are men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
whom the sorrows of a whole people and of a whole
age seem to concentrate. They suffer with their fellow-men
that all may find a way of hope. Not unconsciously,
but with the most vivid sense of duty, a Divine
necessity brought to their door, they must undergo all
the anguish and hew a track through the dense forest
to the light beyond. Such a man in his age was the
writer of this book. And when he now proceeds to the
second stage of Job's affliction every touch appears to
show that, not merely in imagination, but substantially
he endured the trials which he paints. It is his passion
that strives and cries, his sorrowful soul that longs for
death. Imaginary, is this work of his? Nothing so
true, vehement, earnest, can be imaginary. "Sublime
sorrow," says Carlyle, "sublime reconciliation; oldest
choral melody as of the heart of mankind." But it
shows more than "the seeing eye and the mildly understanding
heart." It reveals the spirit battling with
terrible enemies, doubts that spring out of the darkness
of error, brood of the primæval chaos. The man was
one who "in this wild element of a life had to struggle
onwards; now fallen, deep abased; and ever with tears,
repentance, with bleeding heart, rise again, struggle
again, still onwards." Not to this writer, any more
than to the author of "Sartor Resartus," did anything
come in his dreams.</p>

<p>A second scene in heaven is presented to our view.
The Satan appears as before with the "sons of the
Elohim," is asked by the Most High whence he has
come, and replies in the language previously used.
Again he has been abroad amongst men in his restless
search for evil. The challenge of God to the Adversary
regarding Job is also repeated; but now it has an
addition: "Still he holdeth fast his integrity, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without
cause." The expression "although thou movedst me
against him" is startling. Is it an admission after all
that the Almighty can be moved by any consideration
less than pure right, or to act in any way to the disadvantage
or hurt of His servant? Such an interpretation
would exclude the idea of supreme power,
wisdom, and righteousness which unquestionably
governs the book from first to last. The words really
imply a charge against the Adversary of malicious
untruth. The saying of the Almighty is ironical, as
Schultens points out: "Although thou, forsooth, didst
incite Me against him." He who flings sharp javelins
of detraction is pierced with a sharper javelin of
judgment. Yet he goes on with his attempt to ruin
Job, and prove his own penetration the keenest in the
universe.</p>

<p>And now he pleads that it is the way of men to
care more for themselves, their own health and comfort,
than for anything else. Bereavement and poverty may
be like arrows that glance off from polished armour.
Let disease and bodily pain attack himself, and a man
will show what is really in his heart. "Skin for skin,
yea, all that a man hath will he give for himself. But
put forth Thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
flesh, and he will renounce Thee openly."</p>

<p>The proverb put into Satan's mouth carries a plain
enough meaning, and yet is not literally easy to
interpret. The sense will be clear if we translate it
"Hide for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give
for himself." The hide of an animal, lion or sheep,
which a man wears for clothing will be given up to
save his own body. A valued article of property often,
it will be promptly renounced when life is in danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the man will flee away naked. In like manner all
possessions will be abandoned to keep one's self
unharmed. True enough in a sense, true enough to
be used as a proverb, for proverbs often express a
generalisation of the earthly prudence not of the
higher ideal, the saying, nevertheless, is in Satan's
use of it a lie&mdash;that is, if he includes the children when
he says, "all that a man hath will he give for himself."
Job would have died for his children. Many a father
and mother, with far less pride in their children than
Job had in his, would die for them. Possessions
indeed, mere worldly gear, find their real value or
worthlessness when weighed against life, and human
love has Divine depths which a sneering devil cannot
see. The portraiture of soulless human beings is one
of the recent experiments in fictitious literature, and
it may have some justification. When the design is to
show the dreadful issue of unmitigated selfishness,
a distinctly moral purpose. If, on the other hand,
"art for art's sake" is the plea, and the writer's skill
in painting the vacant ribs of death is used with a sinister
reflection on human nature as a whole, the approach
to Satan's temper marks the degradation of literature.
Christian faith clings to the hope that Divine grace
may create a soul in the ghastly skeleton. The
Adversary gloats over the lifeless picture of his own
imagining and affirms that man can never be animated
by the love of God. The problem which the Satan of
Job long ago presented haunts the mind of our age.
It is one of those ominous symptoms that point to
times of trial in which the experience of humanity may
resemble the typical affliction and desperate struggle
of the man of Uz.</p>

<p>A grim possibility of truth lies in the taunt of Satan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that, if Job's flesh and bone are touched, he will
renounce God openly. The test of sore disease is
more trying than loss of wealth at least. And, besides,
bodily affliction, added to the rest, will carry Job into
yet another region of vital experience. Therefore it is
the will of God to send it. Again Satan is the instrument,
and the permission is given, "Behold, he is in
thine hand: only save his life&mdash;imperil not his life."
Here, as before, when causes are to be brought into
operation that are obscure and may appear to involve
harshness, the Adversary is the intermediary agent.
On the face of the drama a certain formal deference
is paid to the opinion that God cannot inflict pain on
those whom He loves. But for a short time only is
the responsibility, so to speak, of afflicting Job partly
removed from the Almighty to Satan. At this point
the Adversary disappears; and henceforth God is
acknowledged to have sent the disease as well as all
the other afflictions to His servant. It is only in a
poetic sense that Satan is represented as wielding
natural forces and sowing the seeds of disease; the
writer has no theory and needs no theory of malignant
activity. He knows that "all is of God."</p>

<p>Time has passed sufficient for the realisation by Job
of his poverty and bereavement. The sense of desolation
has settled on his soul as morning after morning
dawned, week after week went by, emptied of the
loving voices he used to hear, and the delightful
and honourable tasks that used to engage him. In
sympathy with the exhausted mind, the body has
become languid, and the change from sufficiency of
the best food to something like starvation gives the
germs of disease an easy hold. He is stricken with
elephantiasis, one of the most terrible forms of leprosy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a tedious malady attended with intolerable irritation
and loathsome ulcers. The disfigured face, the blackened
body, soon reveal the nature of the infection; and
he is forthwith carried out according to the invariable
custom and laid on the heap of refuse, chiefly burnt
litter, which has accumulated near his dwelling. In
Arab villages this <i>mezbele</i> is often a mound of considerable
size, where, if any breath of wind is blowing, the
full benefit of its coolness can be enjoyed. It is the
common playground of the children, "and there the
outcast, who has been stricken with some loathsome
malady, and is not allowed to enter the dwellings of
men, lays himself down, begging an alms of the
passers-by, by day, and by night sheltering himself
among the ashes which the heat of the sun has
warmed." At the beginning Job was seen in the full
stateliness of Oriental life; now the contrasting misery
of it appears, the abjectness into which it may rapidly
fall. Without proper medical skill or appliances, the
houses no way adapted for a case of disease like Job's,
the wealthiest pass like the poorest into what appears
the nadir of existence. Now at length the trial of
faithfulness is in the way of being perfected. If the
helplessness, the torment of disease, the misery of this
abject state do not move his mind from its trust in
God, he will indeed be a bulwark of religion against
the atheism of the world.</p>

<p>But in what form does the question of Job's continued
fidelity present itself now to the mind of the
writer? Singularly, as a question regarding his
integrity. From the general wreck one life has been
spared, that of Job's wife. To her it appears that the
wrath of the Almighty has been launched against her
husband, and all that prevents him from finding refuge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
in death from the horrors of lingering disease is his
integrity. If he maintains the pious resignation he
showed under the first afflictions and during the early
stages of his malady, he will have to suffer on. But
it will be better to die at once. "Why," she asks,
"dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? Renounce
God, and die." It is a different note from that which
runs through the controversy between Job and his
friends. Always on his integrity he takes his stand;
against his right to affirm it they direct their arguments.
They do not insist on the duty of a man
under all circumstances to believe in God and submit
to His will. Their sole concern is to prove that Job
has not been sincere and faithful and deserving of
acceptance before God. But his wife knows him to
have been righteous and pious; and that, she thinks,
will serve him no longer. Let him abandon his integrity;
renounce God. On two sides the sufferer is
plied. But he does not waver. Between the two he
stands, a man who has integrity and will keep it till
he die.</p>

<p>The accusations of Satan, turning on the question
whether Job was sincere in religion or one who served
God for what he got, prepare us to understand why
his integrity is made the hinge of the debate. To Job
his upright obedience was the heart of his life, and it
alone made his indefeasible claim on God. But faith,
not obedience, is the only real claim a man can advance.
And the connection is to be found in this way. As
a man perfect and upright, who feared God and
eschewed evil, Job enjoyed the approval of his conscience
and the sense of Divine favour. His life had
been rooted in the steady assurance that the Almighty
was his friend. He had walked in freedom and joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
cared for by the providence of the Eternal, guarded by
His love, his soul at peace with that Divine Lawgiver
whose will he did. His faith rested like an arch on
two piers&mdash;one, his own righteousness which God had
inspired; the other, the righteousness of God which
his own reflected. If it were proved that he had not
been righteous, his belief that God had been guarding
him, teaching him, filling his soul with light, would
break under him like a withered branch. If he had
not been righteous indeed, he could not know what
righteousness is, he could not know whether God is
righteous or not, he could not know God nor trust in
Him. The experience of the past was, in this case,
a delusion. He had nothing to rest upon, no faith.
On the other hand, if those afflictions, coming why he
could not tell, proved God to be capricious, unjust,
all would equally be lost. The dilemma was that,
holding to the belief in his own integrity, he seemed
to be driven to doubt God; but if he believed God to
be righteous he seemed to be driven to doubt his own
integrity. Either was fatal. He was in a narrow
strait between two rocks, on one or other of which
faith was like to be shattered.</p>

<p>But his integrity was clear to him. That stood
within the region of his own consciousness. He knew
that God had made him of dutiful heart and given him
a constant will to be obedient. Only while he believed
this could he keep hold of his life. As the one treasure
saved out of the wreck, when possessions, children,
health were gone, to cherish his integrity was the last
duty. Renounce his conscience of goodwill and faithfulness?
It was the one fact bridging the gulf of
disaster, the safeguard against despair. And is this
not a true presentation of the ultimate inquiry regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
faith? If the justice we know is not an adumbration
of Divine justice, if the righteousness we do is not
taught us by God, of the same kind as His, if loving
justice and doing righteousness we are not showing
faith in God, if renouncing all for the right, clinging
to it though the heavens should fall, we are not in
touch with the Highest, then there is no basis for
faith, no link between our human life and the Eternal.
All must go if these deep principles of morality and
religion are not to be trusted. What a man knows
of the just and good by clinging to it, suffering for it,
rejoicing in it, is indeed the anchor that keeps him from
being swept into the waste of waters.</p>

<p>The woman's part in the controversy is still to be considered;
and it is but faintly indicated. Upon the Arab
soul there lay no sense of woman's life. Her view of
providence or of religion was never asked. The writer
probably means here that Job's wife would naturally,
as a woman, complicate the sum of his troubles. She
expresses ill-considered resentment against his piety.
To her he is "righteous over much," and her counsel
is that of despair. Was this all that the Great God
whom he trusted could do for him? Better bid farewell
to such a God. She can do nothing to relieve the
dreadful torment and can see but the one possible end.
But it is God who is keeping her husband alive, and
one word would be enough to set him free. Her
language is strangely illogical, meant indeed to be so,&mdash;a
woman's desperate talk. She does not see that,
though Job renounced God, he might yet live on, in
greater misery than ever, just because he would then
have no spiritual stay.</p>

<p>Well, some have spoken very strongly about Job's
wife. She has been called a helper of the Devil, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
organ of Satan, an infernal fury. Chrysostom thinks
that the Enemy left her alive because he deemed her a
fit scourge to Job by which to plague him more acutely
than by any other. Ewald, with more point, says:
"Nothing can be more scornful than her words which
mean, 'Thou, who under all the undeserved sufferings
which have been inflicted on thee by thy God, hast
been faithful to Him even in fatal sickness, as if He
would help or desired to help thee who art beyond help,&mdash;to
thee, fool, I say, Bid God farewell, and die!'"
There can be no doubt that she appears as the temptress
of her husband, putting into speech the atheistic doubt
which the Adversary could not directly suggest. And
the case is all the worse for Job that affection and
sympathy are beneath her words. Brave and true
life appears to her to profit nothing if it has to be
spent in pain and desolation. She does not seem to
speak so much in scorn as in the bitterness of her soul.
She is no infernal fury, but one whose love, genuine
enough, does not enter into the fellowship of his sufferings.
It was necessary to Job's trial that the temptation
should be presented, and the ignorant affection of the
woman serves the needful purpose. She speaks not
knowing what she says, not knowing that her words
pierce like sharp arrows into his very soul. As a
figure in the drama she has her place, helping to
complete the round of trial.</p>

<p>The answer of Job is one of the fine touches of the
book. He does not denounce her as an instrument of
Satan nor dismiss her from his presence. In the midst
of his pain he is the great chief of Uz and the generous
husband. "Thou speakest," he mildly says, "as one
of the foolish, that is, godless, women speaketh." It is
not like thee to say such things as these. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
he adds the question born of sublime faith, "Shall
we receive gladness at the hand of God, and shall we
not receive affliction?"</p>

<p>One might declare this affirmation of faith so clear
and decisive that the trial of Job as a servant of God
might well close with it. Earthly good, temporal joy,
abundance of possessions, children, health,&mdash;these he
had received. Now in poverty and desolation, his body
wrecked by disease, he lies tormented and helpless.
Suffering of mind and physical affliction are his in
almost unexampled keenness, acute in themselves and
by contrast with previous felicity. His wife, too, instead
of helping him to endure, urges him to dishonour and
death. Still he does not doubt that all is wisely
ordered by God. He puts aside, if indeed with a
strenuous effort of the soul, that cruel suggestion of
despair, and affirms anew the faith which is supposed
to bind him to a life of torment. Should not this repel
the accusations brought against the religion of Job and
of humanity? The author does not think so. He has
only prepared the way for his great discussion. But
the stages of trial already passed show how deep and
vital is the problem that lies beyond. The faith which
has emerged so triumphantly is to be shaken as by
the ruin of the world.</p>

<p>Strangely and erroneously has a distinction been
drawn between the previous afflictions and the disease
which, it is said, "opens or reveals greater depths in
Job's reverent piety." One says: "In his former trial
he blessed God who took away the good He had added
to naked man; this was strictly no evil: now Job
bows beneath God's hand when He inflicts positive
evil." Such literalism in reading the words "shall we
not receive evil?" implies a gross slander on Job. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
he had meant that the loss of health was "evil" as
contrasted with the loss of children, that from his point
of view bereavement was no "evil," then indeed he
would have sinned against love, and therefore against
God. It is the whole course of his trial he is reviewing.
Shall we receive "good"&mdash;joy, prosperity, the love of
children, years of physical vigour, and shall we not
receive pain&mdash;this burden of loss, desolation, bodily
torment? Herein Job sinned not with his lips.
Again, had he meant moral evil, something involving
cruelty and unrighteousness, he would have sinned
indeed, his faith would have been destroyed by his
own false judgment of God. The words here must be
interpreted in harmony with the distinction already
drawn between physical and mental suffering, which,
as God appoints them, have a good design, and moral
evil, which can in no way have its source in Him.</p>

<p>And now the narrative passes into a new phase.
As a chief of Uz, the greatest of the Bene-Kedem, Job
was known beyond the desert. As a man of wisdom
and generosity he had many friends. The tidings of
his disasters and finally of his sore malady are carried
abroad; and after months, perhaps (for a journey across
the sandy waste needs preparation and time), three of
those who know him best and admire him most, "Job's
three friends," appear upon the scene. To sympathise
with him, to cheer and comfort him, they come with one
accord, each on his camel, not unattended, for the way
is beset with dangers.</p>

<p>They are men of mark all of them. The emeer of
Uz has chiefs, no doubt, as his peculiar friends, although
the Septuagint colours too much in calling them kings.
It is, however, their piety, their likeness to himself, as
men who fear and serve the True God, that binds them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to Job's heart. They will contribute what they can of
counsel and wise suggestion to throw light on his trials
and lift him into hope. No arguments of unbelief or
cowardice will be used by them, nor will they propose
that a stricken man should renounce God and die.
Eliphaz is from Teman, that centre of thought and
culture where men worshipped the Most High and
meditated upon His providence. Shuach, the city of
Bildad, can scarcely be identified with the modern
Shuwak, about two hundred and fifty miles south-west
from the Jauf near the Red Sea, nor with the land of
the Tsukhi of the Assyrian inscriptions, lying on the
Chaldæan frontier. It was probably a city, now forgotten,
in the Idumæan region. Maan, also near
Petra, may be the Naamah of Zophar. It is at least
tempting to regard all the three as neighbours who
might without great difficulty communicate with each
other and arrange a visit to their common friend.
From their meeting-place at Teman or at Maan they
would, in that case, have to make a journey of some two
hundred miles across one of the most barren and
dangerous deserts of Arabia,&mdash;clear enough proof of
their esteem for Job and their deep sympathy.</p>

<p>The fine idealism of the poem is maintained in this
new act. Men of knowledge and standing are these.
They may fail; they may take a false view of their
friend and his state; but their sincerity must not be
doubted nor their rank as thinkers. Whether the three
represent ancient culture, or rather the conceptions of
the writer's own time, is a question that may be variously
answered. The book, however, is so full of life, the
life of earnest thought and keen thirst for truth, that
the type of religious belief found in all the three must
have been familiar to the author. These men are not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
any more than Job himself, contemporaries of Ephron
the Hittite or the Balaam of Numbers. They stand
out as religious thinkers of a far later age, and represent
the current Rabbinism of the post-Solomonic era. The
characters are filled in from a profound knowledge
of man and man's life. Yet each of them, Temanite,
Shuchite, Naamathite, is at bottom a Hebrew believer
striving to make his creed apply to a case not yet
brought into his system, and finally, when every suggestion
is repelled, taking refuge in that hardness of temper
which is peculiarly Jewish. They are not men of straw,
as some imagine, but types of the culture and thought
which led to Pharisaism. The writer argues not so
much with Edom as with his own people.</p>

<p>Approaching Job's dwelling the three friends look
eagerly from their camels, and at length perceive one
prostrate, disfigured, lying on the <i>mezbele</i>, a miserable
wreck of manhood. "That is not our friend," they say
to each other. Again and yet again, "This is not he;
this surely cannot be he." Yet nowhere else than in
the place of the forsaken do they find their noble
friend. The brave, bright chief they knew, so stately
in his bearing, so abundant and honourable, how has
he fallen! They lift up their voices and weep; then,
struck into amazed silence, each with torn mantle
and dust-sprinkled head, for seven days and nights
they sit beside him in grief unspeakable.</p>

<p>Real is their sympathy; deep too, as deep as their
character and sentiments admit. As comforters they
are proverbial in a bad sense. Yet one says truly,
perhaps out of bitter experience, "Who that knows
what most modern consolation is can prevent a prayer
that Job's comforters may be his? They do not call
upon him for an hour and invent excuses for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
departure which they so anxiously await; they do not
write notes to him, and go about their business as
if nothing had happened; they do not inflict upon
him meaningless commonplaces."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was their misfortune,
not altogether their fault, that they had mistaken
notions which they deemed it their duty to urge upon
him. Job, disappointed by-and-by, did not spare
them, and we feel so much for him that we are apt to
deny them their due. Yet are we not bound to ask,
What friend has had equal proof of our sympathy?
Depth of nature; sincerity of friendship; the will
to console: let those mock at Job's comforters as
wanting here who have travelled two hundred miles
over the burning sand to visit a man sunk in disaster,
brought to poverty and the gate of death, and sat with
him seven days and nights in generous silence.</p>

<p>While the friends of Job sat beside him that
dreary week of silence, each of them was
meditating in his own way the sudden calamities which
had brought the prosperous emeer to poverty, the
strong man to this extremity of miserable disease.
Many thoughts came and were dismissed; but always
the question returned, Why these disasters, this shadow
of dreadful death? And for very compassion and
sorrow each kept secret the answer that came and
came again and would not be rejected. Meanwhile the
silence has weighed upon the sufferer, and the burden
of it becomes at length insupportable. He has tried
to read their thoughts, to assure himself that grief
alone kept them dumb, that when they spoke it would
be to cheer him with kindly words, to praise and
reinvigorate his faith, to tell him of Divine help that
would not fail him in life or death. But as he sees
their faces darken into inquiry first and then into
suspicion, and reads at length in averted looks the
thought they cannot conceal, when he comprehends
that the men he loved and trusted hold him to be a
transgressor and under the ban of God, this final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
disaster of false judgment is overwhelming. The man
whom all circumstances appear to condemn, who is
bankrupt, solitary, outworn with anxiety and futile
efforts to prove his honour, if he have but one to
believe in him, is helped to endure and hope. But
Job finds human friendship yield like a reed. All the
past is swallowed up in one tragical thought that, be
a man what he may, there is no refuge for him in
the justice of man. Everything is gone that made
human society and existence in the world worth caring
for. His wife, indeed, believes in his integrity, but
values it so little that she would have him cast it
away with a taunt against God. His friends, it is plain
to see, deny it. He is suffering at God's hand, and
they are hardened against him. The iron enters into
his soul.</p>

<p>True, it is the shame and torment of his disease that
move him to utter his bitter lamentation. Yet the
underlying cause of his loss of self-command and of
patient confidence in God must not be missed. The
disease has made life a physical agony; but he could
bear that if still no cloud came between him and the
face of God. Now these dark, suspicious looks which
meet him every time he lifts his eyes, which he feels
resting upon him even when he bows his head in the
attempt to pray, make religion seem a mockery. And
in pitiful anticipation of the doom to which they are
silently driving him, he cries aloud against the life that
remains. He has lived in vain. Would he had never
been born!</p>

<p>In this first lyrical speech put into the mouth of Job
there is an Oriental, hyperbolical strain, suited to the
speaker and his circumstances. But we are also made
to feel that calamity and dejection have gone near to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
unhinging his mind. He is not mad, but his language
is vehement, almost that of insanity. It would be wrong,
therefore, to criticise the words in a matter-of-fact way,
and against the spirit of the book to try by the rules
of Christian resignation one so tossed and racked, in
the very throat of the furnace. This is a pious man,
a patient man, who lately said, "Shall we receive joy at
the hand of God, and shall we not receive affliction?"
He seems to have lost all control of himself and plunges
into wild untamed speech filled with anathemas, as
one who had never feared God. But he is driven from
self-possession. Phantasmal now is all that brave life
of his as prince and as father, as a man in honour
beloved of the Highest. Did he ever enjoy it? If
he did, was it not as in a dream? Was he not rather
a deceiver, a vile transgressor? His state befits that.
Light and love and life are turned into bitter gall. "I
lived," says one distressed like Job, "in a continual,
indefinite, pining fear; tremulous, pusillanimous, apprehensive
of I knew not what; it seemed as if the heavens
and the earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring
monster wherein I, palpitating, waited to be devoured....
'Man is, properly speaking, based upon hope, he has
no other possession but hope; this world of his is emphatically
the Place of Hope.'" We see Job, "for the
present, quite shut out from hope; looking not into the
golden orient, but vaguely all round into a dim firmament
pregnant with earthquake and tornado."</p>

<p>The poem may be read calmly. Let us remember
that it came not calmly from the pen of the writer, but
as the outburst of volcanic feeling from the deep centres
of life. It is Job we hear; the language befits his
despondency, his position in the drama. But surely it
presents to us a real experience of one who, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
hour of Israel's defeat and captivity, had seen his home
swept bare, wife and children seized and tortured or
borne down in the rush of savage soldiery, while he
himself lived on, reduced in one day to awful memories
and doubts as the sole consciousness of life. Is not
some crisis like this with its irretrievable woes translated
for us here into the language of Job's bitter cry? Are
we not made witnesses of a tragedy greater even than
his?</p>

<p>"What is to become of us," asks Amiel, "when
everything leaves us, health, joy, affections, when the
sun seems to have lost its warmth, and life is stripped
of all charm? Must we either harden or forget?
There is but one answer, Keep close to duty, do what
you ought, come what may." The mood of these
words is not so devout as other passages of the same
writer. The advice, however, is often tendered in the
name of religion to the life-weary and desolate; and
there are circumstances to which it well applies. But
a distracting sense of impotence weighed down the
life of Job. Duty? He could do nothing. It was
impossible to find relief in work; hence the fierceness
of his words. Nor can we fail to hear in them a
strain of impatience almost of anger: "To the unregenerate
Prometheus Vinctus of a man, it is ever
the bitterest aggravation of his wretchedness that he
is conscious of virtue, that he feels himself the victim
not of suffering only, but of injustice. What then?
Is the heroic inspiration we name Virtue but some
passion, some bubble of the blood?... Thus has the
bewildered wanderer to stand, as so many have done,
shouting question after question into the sibyl cave of
Destiny, and receive no answer but an echo. It is all
a grim desert, this once fair world of his."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Job is already asserting to himself the reality of his
own virtue, for he resents the suspicion of it. Indeed,
with all the mystery of his affliction yet to solve, he
can but think that Providence is also casting doubt
on him. A keen sense of the favour of God had been
his. Now he becomes aware that while he is still the
same man who moved about in gladness and power,
his life has a different look to others; men and nature
conspire against him. His once brave faith&mdash;the Lord
gave, the Lord hath taken away&mdash;is almost overborne.
He does not renounce, but he has a struggle to save
it. The subtle Divine grace at his heart alone keeps
him from bidding farewell to God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The outburst of Job's speech falls into three lyrical
strophes, the first ending at the tenth verse, the second
at the nineteenth, the third closing with the chapter.</p>

<p>I. "Job opened his mouth and cursed his day."
In a kind of wild impossible revision of providence and
reopening of questions long settled, he assumes the
right of heaping denunciations on the day of his birth.
He is so fallen, so distraught, and the end of his
existence appears to have come in such profound
disaster, the face of God as well as of man frowning
on him, that he turns savagely on the only fact left to
strike at,&mdash;his birth into the world. But the whole
strain is imaginative. His revolt is unreason, not
impiety either against God or his parents. He does
not lose the instinct of a good man, one who keeps in
mind the love of father and mother and the intention
of the Almighty whom he still reveres. Life is an
act of God: he would not have it marred again by
infelicity like his own. So the day as an ideal factor
in history or cause of existence is given up to chaos.</p>

day. Mingled in this is the old world notion of days
having meanings and powers of their own. This day
had proved malign, terribly bad. It was already a
chaotic day, not fit for a man's birth. Let every
natural power of storm and eclipse draw it back to the
void. The night too, as part of the day, comes under
imprecation.</p>

<p>The vividness here is from superstition, fancies of
past generations, old dreams of a child race. Foreign
they would be to the mind of Job in his strength;
but in great disaster the thoughts are apt to fall back
on these levels of ignorance and dim efforts to explain,
omens and powers intangible. It is quite easy to
follow Job in this relapse, half wilful, half for easing
of his bosom. Throughout Arabia, Chaldæa, and India
went a belief in evil powers that might be invoked to
make a particular day one of misfortune. The leviathan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
is the dragon which was thought to cause eclipses by
twining its black coils about the sun and moon. These
vague undertones of belief ran back probably to myths
of the sky and the storm, and Job ordinarily must
have scorned them. Now, for the time, he chooses
to make them serve his need of stormy utterance.
If any who hear him really believe in magicians
and their spells, they are welcome to gather through
that belief a sense of his condition; or if they choose
to feel pious horror, they may be shocked. He flings
out maledictions, knowing in his heart that they are
vain words.</p>

<p>Is it not something strange that the happy past is
here entirely forgotten? Why has Job nothing to say
of the days that shone brightly upon him? Have
they no weight in the balance against pain and grief?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">"The tempest in my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth from my senses take all feeling else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save what beats there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His mind is certainly clouded; for it is not vain to
say that piety preserves the thought of what God once
gave, and Job had himself spoken of it when his disease
was young. At this point he is an example of what
man is when he allows the water-floods to overflow him
and the sad present to extinguish a brighter past. The
sense of a wasted life is upon him, because he does
not yet understand what the saving of life is. To be
kind to others and to be happy in one's own kindness is
not for man so great a benefit, so high a use of life, as
to suffer with others and for them. What were the
life of our Lord on earth and His death but a revelation
to man of the secret he had never grasped and
still but half approves? The Book of Job, a long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
yearning cry out of the night, shows how the world
needed Christ to shed His Divine light upon all our
experiences and unite them in a religion of sacrifice
and triumph. The book moves toward that reconciliation
which only the Christ can achieve. As yet,
looking at the sufferer here, we see that the light of
the future has not dawned upon him. Only when he
is brought to bay by the falsehoods of man, in the
absolute need of his soul, will he boldly anticipate the
redemption and fling himself for refuge on a justifying
God.</p>

<p>II. In the second strophe cursing is exchanged for
wailing, fruitless reproach of a long past day for a
touching chant in praise of the grave. If his birth
had to be, why could he not have passed at once into
the shades? The lament, though not so passionate, is
full of tragic emotion. The phrases of it have been
woven into a modern hymn and used to express what
Christians may feel; but they are pagan in tone, and
meant by the writer to embody the unhopeful thought
of the race. Here is no outlook beyond the inanition
of death, the oblivion and silence of the tomb. It is
not the extreme of unfaith, but rather of weakness and
misery.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Wherefore hastened the knees to meet me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And why the breasts that I should suck?</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>Small and great are there the same,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The slave set free from his lord.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is beautiful poetry, and the images have a singular
charm for the dejected mind. The chief point, however,
for us to notice is the absence of any thought of judgment.
In the dim under-world, hid as beneath heavy
clouds, power and energy are not. Existence has
fallen to so low an ebb that it scarcely matters whether
men were good or bad in this life, nor is it needful to
separate them. For the tyrant can do no more harm
to the captive, nor the robber to his victim. The
astute councillor is no better than the slave. It is a
kind of existence below the level of moral judgment,
below the level either of fear or joy. From the peacefulness
of this region none are excluded; as there will
be no strength to do good there will be none to do
evil. "The small and great are there the same." The
stillness and calm of the dead body deceive the mind,
willing in its wretchedness to be deceived.</p>

<p>When the writer put this chant into the mouth of
Job, he had in memory the pyramids of Egypt and
tombs, like those of Petra, carved in the lonely hills.
The contrast is thus made picturesque between the
state of Job lying in loathsome disease and the lot of
those who are gathered to the mighty dead. For
whether the rich are buried in their stately sepulchres,
or the body of a slave is hastily covered with desert
sand, all enter into one painless repose. The whole
purpose of the passage is to mark the extremity of
hopelessness, the mind revelling in images of its own
decay. We are not meant to rest in that love of death
from which Job vainly seeks comfort. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
we are to see him by-and-by roused to interest in life
and its issues. This is no halting-place in the poem,
as it often is in human thought. A great problem of
Divine righteousness hangs unsolved. With the death
of the prisoner and the down-trodden slave whose
worn-out body is left a prey to the vulture&mdash;with the
death of the tyrant whose evil pride has built a stately
tomb for his remains&mdash;all is not ended. Peace has not
come. Rather has the unravelling of the tangle to
begin. The All-righteous has to make His inquisition
and deal out the justice of eternity. Modern poetry, however,
often repeats in its own way the old-world dream,
mistaking the silence and composure of the dead face
for a spiritual deliverance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The aching craze to live ends, and life glides<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lifeless&mdash;to nameless quiet, nameless joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blessed Nirvana, sinless, stirless rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That change which never changes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To Christianity this idea is utterly foreign, yet it mingles
with some religious teaching, and is often to be found
in the weaker sorts of religious fiction and verse.</p>

<p>III. The last portion of Job's address begins with a
note of inquiry. He strikes into eager questioning of
heaven and earth regarding his state. What is he
kept alive for? He pursues death with his longing
as one goes into the mountains to seek treasure. And
again, his way is hid; he has no future. God hath
hedged him in on this side by losses, on that by grief;
behind a past mocks him, before is a shape which he
follows and yet dreads.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Wherefore gives He light to wretched men</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Life to the bitter in soul?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who long for death but no!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Search for it more than for treasures.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It is indeed a horrible condition, this of the baffled
mind to which nothing remains but its own gnawing
thought that finds neither reason of being nor end of
turmoil, that can neither cease to question nor find
answer to inquiries that rack the spirit. There is
energy enough, life enough to feel life a terror, and no
more; not enough for any mastery even of stoical
resolve. The power of self-consciousness seems to be
the last injury, a Nessus-shirt, the gift of a strange
hate. "The real agony is the silence, the ignorance
of the why and the wherefore, the Sphinx-like imperturbability
which meets his prayers." This struggle
for a light that will not come has been expressed by
Matthew Arnold in his "Empedocles on Etna," a poem
which may in some respects be named a modern
version of Job:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This heart will glow no more; thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A living man no more, Empedocles!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nothing but a devouring flame of thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a naked eternally restless mind....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the elements it came from<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Everything will return&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our bodies to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our blood to water,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heat to fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Breath to air.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They were well born,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They will be well entombed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But mind, but thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where will they find their parent element?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What will receive them, who will call them home?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But we shall still be in them and they in us....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we shall be unsatisfied as now;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we shall feel the agony of thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ineffable longing for the life of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Baffled for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thought yields no result; the outer universe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
dumb and impenetrable. Still Job would revive if a
battle for righteousness offered itself to him. He has
never had to fight for God or for his own faith. When
the trumpet call is heard he will respond; but he is
not yet aware of hearing it.</p>

<p>The closing verses have presented considerable
difficulty to interpreters, who on the one hand shrink
from the supposition that Job is going back on his past
life of prosperity and finding there the origin of his
fear, and on the other hand see the danger of leaving
so significant a passage without definite meaning. The
Revised Version puts all the verbs of the twenty-fifth
and twenty-sixth verses into the present tense, and Dr.
A. B. Davidson thinks translation into the past tense
would give a meaning "contrary to the idea of the poem."
Now, a considerable interval had already elapsed from
the time of Job's calamities, even from the beginning
of his illness, quite long enough to allow the growth of
anxiety and fear as to the judgment of the world.
Job was not ignorant of the caprice and hardness of
men. He knew how calamity was interpreted; he knew
that many who once bowed to his greatness already
heaped scorn upon his fall. May not his fear have
been that his friends from beyond the desert would
furnish the last and in some respects most cutting of
his sorrows?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I have feared a fear; it has come upon me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And that which I dread has come to me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I have not been at ease, nor quiet, nor have I had rest;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet trouble has come.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In his brooding soul, those seven days and nights,
fear has deepened into certainty. He is a man despised.
Even for those three his circumstances have proved too
much. Did he imagine for a moment that their coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
might relieve the pressure of his lot and open a way
to the recovery of his place among men? The trouble
is deeper than ever; they have stirred a tempest in his
breast.</p>

<p>Note that in his whole agony Job makes no motion
towards suicide. Arnold's Empedocles cries against
life, flings out his questions to a dumb universe, and
then plunges into the crater of Etna. Here, as at
other points, the inspiration of the author of our book
strikes clear between stoicism and pessimism, defiance
of the world to do its worst and confession that the
struggle is too terrible. The deep sense of all that is
tragic in life, and, with this, the firm persuasion that
nothing is appointed to man but what he is able to
bear, together make the clear Bible note. It may
seem that Job's ejaculations differ little from the cry
out of the "City of Dreadful Night,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Weary of erring in this desert, Life,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Weary of hoping hopes for ever vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Weary of struggling in all sterile strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Weary of thought which maketh nothing plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I close my eyes and calm my panting breath<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And pray to thee, O ever quiet Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To come and soothe away my bitter pain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the writer of the book knows what is in hand.
He has to show how far faith may be pressed down
and bent by the sore burdens of life without breaking.
He has to give us the sense of a soul in the uttermost
depth, that we may understand the sublime argument
which follows, know its importance, and find our own
tragedy exhibited, our own need met, the personal and
the universal marching together to an issue. Suicide
is no issue for a life, any more than universal
cataclysm for the evolution of a world. Despair is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
refuge. The inspired writer here sees so far, so clearly,
that to mention suicide would be absurd. The struggle
of life cannot be renounced. So much he knows by
a spiritual instinct which anticipates the wisdom of
later times. Were this book a simple record of fact,
we have Job in a position far more trying than that
of Saul after his defeat on Gilboa; but it is an ideal
prophetic writing, a Divine poem, and the faith it is
designed to commend saves the man from interfering
by any deed of his with the will of God.</p>

<p>We are prepared for the vehement controversy that
follows and the sustained appeal of the sufferer to
that Power which has laid upon him such a weight
of agony. When he breaks into passionate cries and
seems to be falling away from all trust, we do not
despair of him nor of the cause he represents. The
intensity with which he longs for death is actually a
sign and measure of the strong life that throbs within
him, which yet will be led out into light and freedom
and come to peace as it were in the very clash of revolt.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE THINGS ELIPHAZ HAD SEEN.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Eliphaz speaks. Chaps.</span> iv., v.</p>


<p>The ideas of sin and suffering against which the
poem of Job was written come now dramatically
into view. The belief of the three friends had always
been that God, as righteous Governor of human life,
gives felicity in proportion to obedience and appoints
trouble in exact measure of disobedience. Job himself,
indeed, must have held the same creed. We may
imagine that while he was prosperous his friends had
often spoken with him on this very point. They had
congratulated him often on the wealth and happiness
he enjoyed as an evidence of the great favour of the
Almighty. In conversation they had remarked on case
after case which seemed to prove, beyond the shadow
of doubt, that if men reject God affliction and disaster
invariably follow. Their idea of the scheme of things
was very simple, and, on the whole, it had never come
into serious questioning. Of course human justice,
even when rudely administered, and the practice of
private revenge helped to fulfil their theory of Divine
government. If any serious crime was committed,
those friendly to the injured person took up his cause
and pursued the wrong-doer to inflict retribution upon
him. His dwelling was perhaps burned and his flocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
dispersed, he himself driven into a kind of exile. The
administration of law was rude, yet the unwritten
code of the desert made the evil-doer suffer and allowed
the man of good character to enjoy life if he could.
These facts went to sustain the belief that God was
always regulating a man's happiness by his deserts.
And beyond this, apart altogether from what was done
by men, not a few accidents and calamities appeared
to show Divine judgment against wrong. Then, as
now, it might be said that avenging forces lurk in the
lightning, the storm, the pestilence, forces which are
directed against transgressors and cannot be evaded.
Men would say, Yes, though one hide his crimes,
though he escape for long the condemnation and
punishment of his fellows, yet the hand of God will
find him: and the prediction seemed always to be
verified. Perhaps the stroke did not fall at once.
Months might pass; years might pass; but the time
came when they could affirm, Now righteousness has
overtaken the offender; his crime is rewarded; his
pride is brought low. And if, as happened occasionally,
the flocks of a man who was in good reputation died
of murrain, and his crops were blighted by the terrible
hot wind of the desert, they could always say, Ah!
we did not know all about him. No doubt if we could
look into his private life we should see why this has
befallen. So the barbarians of the island of Melita,
when Paul had been shipwrecked there, seeing a viper
fasten on his hand, said, "No doubt this is a murderer
whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet justice
suffereth not to live."</p>

<p>Thoughts like these were in the minds of the three
friends of Job, very confounding indeed, for they had
never expected to shake their heads over him. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
accordingly deserve credit for true sympathy, inasmuch
as they refrained from saying anything that might hurt
him. His grief was great, and it might be due to remorse.
His unparalleled afflictions put him, as it were,
in sanctuary from taunts or even questionings. He has
done wrong, he has not been what we thought him,
they said to themselves, but he is drinking to the bitter
dregs a cup of retribution.</p>

<p>But when Job opened his mouth and spoke, their
sympathy was dashed with pious horror. They had
never in all their lives heard such words. He seemed
to prove himself far worse than they could have
imagined. He ought to have been meek and submissive.
Some flaw there must have been: what was it?
He should have confessed his sin instead of cursing
life and reflecting on God. Their own silent suspicion,
indeed, is the chief cause of his despair; but this they
do not understand. Amazed they hear him; outraged,
they take up the challenge he offers. One after another
the three men reason with Job, from almost the same
point of view, suggesting first and then insisting that
he should acknowledge fault and humble himself under
the hand of a just and holy God.</p>

<p>Now, here is the motive of the long controversy
which is the main subject of the poem. And, in tracing
it, we are to see Job, although racked by pain and
distraught by grief&mdash;sadly at disadvantage because he
seems to be a living example of the truth of their ideas&mdash;rousing
himself to the defence of his integrity and
contending for that as the only grip he has of God.
Advance after advance is made by the three, who
gradually become more dogmatic as the controversy
proceeds. Defence after defence is made by Job, who
is driven to think himself challenged not only by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
friends, but sometimes also by God Himself through
them.</p>

<p>Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar agree in the opinion
that Job has done evil and is suffering for it. The
language they use and the arguments they bring
forward are much alike. Yet a difference will be
found in their way of speaking, and a vaguely suggested
difference of character. Eliphaz gives us an impression
of age and authority. When Job has ended
his complaint, Eliphaz regards him with a disturbed
and offended look. "How pitiful!" he seems to
say; but also, "How dreadful, how unaccountable!"
He desires to win Job to a right view of things by
kindly counsel; but he talks pompously, and preaches
too much from the high moral bench. Bildad, again,
is a dry and composed person. He is less the man
of experience than of tradition. He does not speak of
discoveries made in the course of his own observation;
but he has stored the sayings of the wise and reflected
upon them. When a thing is cleverly said he is satisfied,
and he cannot understand why his impressive
statements should fail to convince and convert. He
is a gentleman, like Eliphaz, and uses courtesy. At
first he refrains from wounding Job's feelings. Yet
behind his politeness is the sense of superior wisdom&mdash;the
wisdom of ages, and his own. He is certainly a
harder man than Eliphaz. Lastly, Zophar is a blunt
man with a decidedly rough, dictatorial style. He is
impatient of the waste of words on a matter so plain,
and prides himself on coming to the point. It is he
who ventures to say definitely: "Know therefore
that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity
deserveth,"&mdash;a cruel speech from any point of view.
He is not so eloquent as Eliphaz, he has no air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
a prophet. Compared with Bildad he is less argumentative.
With all his sympathy&mdash;and he, too, is a
friend&mdash;he shows an exasperation which he justifies
by his zeal for the honour of God. The differences
are delicate, but real, and evident even to our late
criticism. In the author's day the characters would
probably seem more distinctly contrasted than they
appear to us. Still, it must be owned, each holds
virtually the same position. One prevailing school of
thought is represented and in each figure attacked.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine three speakers differing far
more from each other. For example, instead of Bildad
we might have had a Persian full of the Zoroastrian
ideas of two great powers, the Good Spirit, Ahuramazda,
and the Evil Spirit, Ahriman. Such a one
might have maintained that Job had given himself
to the Evil Spirit, or that his revolt against providence
would bring him under that destructive power and
work his ruin. And then, instead of Zophar, one
might have been set forward who maintained that
good and evil make no difference, that all things
come alike to all, that there is no God who cares for
righteousness among men; assailing Job's faith in a
more dangerous way. But the writer has no such
view of making a striking drama. His circle of vision
is deliberately chosen. It is only what might appear
to be true he allows his characters to advance. One
hears the breathings of the same dogmatism in the
three voices. All is said for the ordinary belief that
can be said. And three different men reason with Job
that it may be understood how popular, how deeply
rooted is the notion which the whole book is meant
to criticise and disprove. The dramatising is vague,
not at all of our sharp, modern kind like that of Ibsen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
throwing each figure into vivid contrast with every
other. All the author's concern is to give full play
to the theory which holds the ground and to show its
incompatibility with the facts of human life, so that it
may perish of its own hollowness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the first address to Job is eloquent
and poetically beautiful. No rude arguer is Eliphaz
but one of the golden-mouthed, mistaken in creed but
not in heart, a man whom Job might well cherish as a
friend.</p>

<p>I. The first part of his speech extends to the
eleventh verse. With the respect due to sorrow,
putting aside the dismay caused by Job's wild language,
he asks, "If one essay to commune with thee, wilt thou
be grieved?" It seems unpardonable to add to the
sufferer's misery by saying what he has in his mind;
and yet&mdash;he cannot refrain. "Who can withhold himself
from speaking?" The state of Job is such that
there must be thorough and very serious communication.
Eliphaz reminds him of what he had been&mdash;an
instructor of the ignorant, one who strengthened the
weak, upheld the falling, confirmed the feeble. Was
he not once so confident of himself, so resolute and
helpful that fainting men found him a bulwark against
despair? Should he have changed so completely?
Should one like him take to fruitless wailings and
complaints? "Now it cometh upon thee, and thou
faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art confounded."
Eliphaz does not mean to taunt. It is in sorrow that
he speaks, pointing out the contrast between what was
and is. Where is the strong faith of former days?
There is need for it, and Job ought to have it as his
stay. "Is not thy piety thy confidence? Thy hope,
is it not the integrity of thy ways?" Why does he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
not look back and take courage? Pious fear of God,
if he allows himself to be guided by it, will not fail to
lead him again into the light.</p>

<p>It is a friendly and sincere effort to make the
champion of God serve himself of his own faith.
The undercurrent of doubt is not allowed to appear.
Eliphaz makes it a wonder that Job had dropped his
claim on the Most High; and he proceeds in a tone of
expostulation, amazed that a man who knew the way
of the Almighty should fall into the miserable weakness
of the worst evil-doer. Poetically, yet firmly, the idea
is introduced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Bethink thee now, who ever, being innocent, perished,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And where have the upright been destroyed?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As I have seen, they who plough iniquity</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And sow disaster reap the same.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>By the wrath of God they perish,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>By the storm of His wrath they are undone.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Roaring of the lion, voice of the growling lion,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The whelps of the lioness are scattered.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>First among the things Eliphaz has seen is the fate of
those violent evil-doers who plough iniquity and sow
disaster. But Job has not been like them and therefore
has no need to fear the harvest of perdition. He is
among those who are not finally cut off. In the tenth
and eleventh verses the dispersion of a den of lions is
the symbol of the fate of those who are hot in wickedness.
As in some cave of the mountains an old lion and
lioness with their whelps dwell securely, issuing forth
at their will to seize the prey and make night dreadful
with their growling, so those evil-doers flourish for a
time in hateful and malignant strength. But as on a
sudden the hunters, finding the lions' retreat, kill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
scatter them, young and old, so the coalition of wicked
men is broken up. The rapacity of wild desert tribes
appears to be reflected in the figure here used. Eliphaz
may be referring to some incident which had actually
occurred.</p>

<p>II. In the second division of his address he endeavours
to bring home to Job a needed moral lesson
by detailing a vision he once had and the oracle which
came with it. The account of the apparition is couched
in stately and impressive language. That chilling
sense of fear which sometimes mingles with our dreams
in the dead of night, the sensation of a presence that
cannot be realised, something awful breathing over the
face and making the flesh creep, an imagined voice
falling solemnly on the ear,&mdash;all are vividly described.
In the recollection of Eliphaz the circumstances of the
vision are very clear, and the finest poetic skill is used
in giving the whole solemn dream full justice and
effect.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Now a word was secretly brought me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Mine ear caught the whisper thereof;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In thoughts from visions of the night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When deep sleep falls upon men,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>A terror came on me, and trembling</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Which thrilled my bones to the marrow.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then a breath passed before my face,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The hairs of my body rose erect.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>It stood still&mdash;its appearance I trace not.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>An image is before mine eyes.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>There was silence, and I heard a voice&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Shall man beside Eloah be righteous?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or beside his Maker shall man be clean?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are made to feel here how extraordinary the
vision appeared to Eliphaz, and, at the same time, how
far short he comes of the seer's gift. For what is this
apparition? Nothing but a vague creation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
dreaming mind. And what is the message? No new
revelation, no discovery of an inspired soul. After
all, only a fact quite familiar to pious thought. The
dream oracle has been generally supposed to continue
to the end of the chapter. But the question as to the
righteousness of man and his cleanness beside God
seems to be the whole of it, and the rest is Eliphaz's
comment or meditation upon it, his "thoughts from
visions of the night."</p>

<p>As to the oracle itself: while the words may certainly
bear translating so as to imply a direct comparison
between the righteousness of man and the righteousness
of God, this is not required by the purpose of the
writer, as Dr. A. B. Davidson has shown. In the form
of a question it is impressively announced that with or
beside the High God no weak man is righteous, no
strong man pure; and this is sufficient, for the aim of
Eliphaz is to show that troubles may justly come on
Job, as on others, because all are by nature imperfect.
No doubt the oracle might transcend the scope of
the argument. Still the question has not been raised
by Job's criticism of providence, whether he reckons
himself more just than God; and apart from that any
comparison seems unnecessary, meeting no mood of
human revolt of which Eliphaz has ever heard. The
oracle, then, is practically of the nature of a truism,
and, as such, agrees with the dream vision and the
impalpable ghost, a dim presentation by the mind
to itself of what a visitor from the higher world
might be.</p>

<p>Shall any created being, inheritor of human defects,
stand beside Eloah, clean in His sight? Impossible.
For, however sincere and earnest any one may be
toward God and in the service of men, he cannot pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the fallibility and imperfection of the creature. The
thought thus solemnly announced, Eliphaz proceeds to
amplify in a prophetic strain, which, however, does not
rise above the level of good poetry.</p>

<p>"Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants."
Nothing that the best of them have to do is committed
entirely to them; the supervision of Eloah is always
maintained that their defects may not mar His purpose.
"His angels He chargeth with error." Even the
heavenly spirits, if we are to trust Eliphaz, go astray;
they are under a law of discipline and holy correction.
In the Supreme Light they are judged and often found
wanting. To credit this to a Divine oracle would be
somewhat disconcerting to ordinary theological ideas.
But the argument is clear enough,&mdash;If even the angelic
servants of God require the constant supervision of
His wisdom and their faults need His correction, much
more do men whose bodies are "houses of clay, whose
foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the
moth"&mdash;that is, the moth which breeds corrupting
worms. "From morning to evening they are destroyed"&mdash;in
a single day their vigour and beauty
pass into decay.</p>

<p>"Without observance they perish for ever," says
Eliphaz. Clearly this is not a word of Divine prophecy.
It would place man beneath the level of moral judgment,
as a mere earth-creature whose life and death are
of no account even to God. Men go their way when a
comrade falls, and soon forget. True enough. But
"One higher than the highest regardeth." The stupidity
or insensibility of most men to spiritual things is
in contrast to the attention and judgment of God.</p>

<p>The description of man's life on earth, its brevity
and dissolution, on account of which he can never exalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
himself as just and clean beside God, ends with words
that may be translated thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Is not their cord torn asunder in them?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They shall die, and not in wisdom.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the tearing up of the tent cord or the breaking
of the bow-string is an image of the snapping of that
chain of vital functions, the "silver cord," on which
the bodily life depends.</p>

<p>The argument of Eliphaz, so far, has been, first, that
Job, as a pious man, should have kept his confidence
in God, because he was not like those who plough
iniquity and sow disaster and have no hope in Divine
mercy; next, that before the Most High all are more
or less unrighteous and impure, so that if Job suffers
for defect, he is no exception, his afflictions are not to
be wondered at. And this carries the further thought
that he ought to be conscious of fault and humble
himself under the Divine hand. Just at this point
Eliphaz comes at last within sight of the right way to
find Job's heart and conscience. The corrective discipline
which all need was safe ground to take with
one who could not have denied in the last resort that
he, too, had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Sins of will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defects of doubt and taints of blood."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This strain of argument, however, closes, Eliphaz having
much in his mind which has not found expression
and is of serious import.</p>

<p>III. The speaker sees that Job is impatient of the
sufferings which make life appear useless to him. But
suppose he appealed to the saints&mdash;holy ones, or
angels&mdash;to take his part, would that be of any use?
In his cry from the depth he had shown resentment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and hasty passion. These do not insure, they do not
deserve help. The "holy ones" would not respond
to a man so unreasonable and indignant. On the contrary,
"resentment slayeth the foolish man, passion
killeth the silly." What Job had said in his outcry
only tended to bring on him the fatal stroke of God.
Having caught at this idea, Eliphaz proceeds in a
manner rather surprising. He has been shocked by
Job's bitter words. The horror he felt returns upon
him, and he falls into a very singular and inconsiderate
strain of remark. He does not, indeed, identify
his old friend with the foolish man whose destruction
he proceeds to paint. But an instance has occurred
to him&mdash;a bit of his large experience&mdash;of one who
behaved in a godless, irrational way and suffered for it;
and for Job's warning, because he needs to take home
the lesson of the catastrophe, Eliphaz details the story.
Forgetting the circumstances of his friend, utterly
forgetting that the man lying before him has lost all his
children and that robbers have swallowed his substance,
absorbed in his own reminiscence to the exclusion of
every other thought, Eliphaz goes deliberately through
a whole roll of disasters so like Job's that every word
is a poisoned arrow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Plead then: will any one answer thee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nay, resentment killeth the fool,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And hasty indignation slayeth the silly.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I myself have seen a godless fool take root;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet straightway I cursed his habitation:&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>His children are far from succour,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They are crushed in the gate without deliverer:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>While the hungry eats up his harvest</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And snatches it even out of the thorns,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the snare gapes for their substance.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The desolation he saw come suddenly, even when
the impious man had just taken root as founder of
a family, Eliphaz declares to be a curse from the Most
High; and he describes it with much force. Upon
the children of the household disaster falls at the gate
or place of judgment; there is no one to plead for
them, because the father is marked for the vengeance
of God. Predatory tribes from the desert devour first
the crops in the remoter fields, and then those protected
by the thorn hedge near the homestead. The man
had been an oppressor; now those he had oppressed
are under no restraint, and all he has is swallowed up
without redress.</p>

<p>So much for the third attempt to convict Job and
bring him to confession. It is a bolt shot apparently
at a venture, yet it strikes where it must wound to
the quick. Here, however, made aware, perhaps by
a look of anguish or a sudden gesture, that he has
gone too far, Eliphaz draws back. To the general
dogma that affliction is the lot of every human being
he returns, that the sting may be taken out of his
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For disaster cometh not forth from the dust,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And out of the ground trouble springeth not;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But man is born unto trouble</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As the sparks fly upward.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By this vague piece of moralising, which sheds no light
on anything, Eliphaz betrays himself. He shows that
he is not anxious to get at the root of the matter. The
whole subject of pain and calamity is external to him,
not a part of his own experience. He would speak
very differently if he were himself deprived of all his
possessions and laid low in trouble. As it is he can
turn glibly from one thought to another, as if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
mattered not which fits the case. In fact, as he
advances and retreats we discover that he is feeling
his way, aiming first at one thing, then at another, in
the hope that this or that random arrow may hit the
mark. No man is just beside God. Job is like the rest,
crushed before the moth. Job has spoken passionately,
in wild resentment. Is he then among the foolish
whose habitation is cursed? But again, lest that
should not be true, the speaker falls back on the
common lot of men, born to trouble&mdash;why, God alone
can tell. Afterwards he makes another suggestion.
Is not God He who frustrates the devices of the crafty
and confounds the cunning, so that they grope in the
blaze of noon as if it were night? If the other explanations
did not apply to Job's condition, perhaps
this would. At all events something might be said by
way of answer that would give an inkling of the truth.
At last the comparatively kind and vague explanation
is offered, that Job suffers from the chastening of the
Lord, who, though He afflicts, is also ready to heal.
Glancing at all possibilities which occur to him,
Eliphaz leaves the afflicted man to accept that which
happens to come home.</p>

<p>IV. Eloquence, literary skill, sincerity, mark the close
of this address. It is the argument of a man who is
anxious to bring his friend to a right frame of mind
so that his latter days may be peace. "As for me,"
he says, hinting what Job should do, "I would turn
to God, and set my expectation upon the Highest."
Then he proceeds to give his thoughts on Divine providence.
Unsearchable, wonderful are the doings of
God. He is the Rain-giver for the thirsty fields and
desert pastures. Among men, too, He makes manifest
His power, exalting those who are lowly, and restoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the joy of the mourners. Crafty men, who plot to
make their own way, oppose His sovereign power in
vain. They are stricken as if with blindness. Out
of their hand the helpless are delivered, and hope is
restored to the feeble. Has Job been crafty? Has
he been in secret a plotter against the peace of men?
Is it for this reason God has cast him down? Let him
repent, and he shall yet be saved. For</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Happy is the man whom Eloah correcteth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Therefore spurn not thou the chastening of Shaddai.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>He smiteth, but His hands make whole.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In six straits He will deliver thee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In seven also shall not evil touch thee.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In famine He will rescue thee from death,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And in war from the power of the sword.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>Nor shalt thou fear when desolation cometh.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>And of the beasts of the earth shalt not be afraid.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For with the stones of the field shall be thy covenant;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>With thee shall the beasts of the field be at peace.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>Behold! This we have searched out: thus it is.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Hear it, and, thou, consider it for thyself!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Fine, indeed, as dramatic poetry; but is it not, as
reasoning, incoherent? The author does not mean it
to be convincing. He who is chastened and receives
the chastening may not be saved in those six troubles,
yea seven. There is more of dream than fact. Eliphaz
is apparently right in everything, as Dillmann says;
but right only on the surface. <i>He has seen</i>&mdash;that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
who plough iniquity and sow disaster reap the same.
<i>He has seen</i>&mdash;a vision of the night, and received a
message; a sign of God's favour that almost made him
a prophet. <i>He has seen</i>&mdash;a fool or impious man taking
root, but was not deceived; he knew what would be the
end, and took upon him to curse judicially the doomed
homestead. <i>He has seen</i>&mdash;the crafty confounded.
<i>He has seen</i>&mdash;the man whom God corrected, who received
his chastisement with submission, rescued and
restored to honour. "Lo, this we have searched out,"
he says; "it is even thus." But the piety and orthodoxy
of the good Eliphaz do not save him from
blunders at every turn. And to the clearing of Job's
position he offers no suggestion of value. What does
he say to throw light on the condition of a believing,
earnest servant of the Almighty who is <i>always</i> poor,
<i>always</i> afflicted, who meets disappointment after disappointment,
and is pursued by sorrow and disaster
even to the grave? The religion of Eliphaz is made
for well-to-do people like himself, and such only. If
it were true that, because all are sinful before God,
affliction and pain are punishments of sin, and a man
is happy in receiving this Divine correction, why is
Eliphaz himself not lying like Job upon a heap of
ashes, racked with the torment of disease? Good
orthodox prosperous man, he thinks himself a prophet,
but he is none. Were he tried like Job he would be
as unreasonable and passionate, as wild in his declamation
against life, as eager for death.</p>

<p>Useless in religion is all mere talk that only skims
the surface, however often the terms of it may be
repeated, however widely they find acceptance. The
creed that breaks down at any point is no creed for
a rational being. Infidelity in our day is very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the consequence of crude notions about God that contradict
each other, notions of the atonement, of the
meaning of suffering, of the future life, that are
incoherent, childish, of no practical weight. People
think they have a firm grasp of the truth; but when
circumstances occur which are at variance with their
preconceived ideas, they turn away from religion, or their
religion makes the facts of life appear worse for them.
It is the result of insufficient thought. Research must
go deeper, must return with new zeal to the study of
Scripture and the life of Christ. God's revelation in
providence and Christianity is one. It has a profound
coherency, the stamp and evidence of its truth. The
rigidity of natural law has its meaning for us in our
study of the spiritual life.</p>

<p>Worst to endure of all things is the grief that
preys on a man's own heart because no channel
outside self is provided for the hot stream of thought.
Now that Eliphaz has spoken, Job has something
to arouse him, at least to resentment. The strength
of his mind revives as he finds himself called to a
battle of words. And how energetic he is! The long
address of Eliphaz we saw to be incoherent, without
the backbone of any clear conviction, turning hither
and thither in the hope of making some way or other
a happy hit. But as soon as Job begins to speak
there is coherency, strong thought running through
the variety of expression, the anxiety for instruction,
the sense of bewilderment and trouble. We feel at
once that we are in contact with a mind no half-truths
can satisfy, that will go with whatever difficulty
to the very bottom of the matter.</p>

<p>Supreme mark of a healthy nature, this. People
are apt to praise a mind at peace, moving composedly
from thought to thought, content "to enjoy the things
which others understand," not distressed by moral
questions. But minds enjoying such peace are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
to be praised if the philosophy of life has been searched
out and tried, and the great trust in God which
resolves all doubt has been found. While life and
providence, one's own history and the history of the
world present what appear to be contradictions,
problems that baffle and disturb the soul, how can
a healthy mind be at rest? Our intellectual powers
are not given simply that we may enjoy; they are
given that we may understand. A mind hungers
for knowledge, as a body for food, and cannot be
satisfied unless the reason and the truth of things
are seen. You may object that some are not
capable of understanding, that indeed Divine providence,
the great purposes of God, lie so far and so
high beyond the ordinary human range as to be
incomprehensible to most of us. Of what use, then,
is revelation? Is it given merely to bewilder us, to
lead us on in a quest which at the last must leave
many of the searchers unsatisfied, without light or
hope? If so, the Bible mocks us, the prophets were
deceivers, even Christ Himself is found no Light of
the world, but a dreamer who spoke of that which can
never be realised. Not thus do I begin in doubt, and
end in doubt. There are things beyond me; but
exact or final knowledge of these is not necessary.
Within my range and reach through nature and
religion, through the Bible and the Son of God, are
the principles I need to satisfy my soul's hunger.
And in every healthy mind there will be desire for
truth which, often baffled, will continue till understanding
comes.</p>

<p>And here we join issue with the agnostic, who
denies this vital demand of the soul. Our thought
dwelling on life and all its varied experience&mdash;sorrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and fear, misery and hope, love threatened by death
yet unquenchable, the exultation of duty, the baffling
of ambition, unforeseen peril and unexpected deliverance&mdash;our
thought, I say, dealing with these elements
of life, will not rest in the notion that all
is due to chance or to blind forces, that evolution
can never be intelligently followed. The modern
atheist or agnostic falls into the very error for
which he used to reprove faith when he contemptuously
bids us get rid of the hope of understanding
the world and the Power directing it, when he
invites us to remember our limitations and occupy
ourselves with things within our range. Religion
used to be taunted with crippling man's faculties and
denying full play to his mental activity. Scientific
unbelief does so now. It restricts us to the seen and
temporal, and, if consistent, ought to refuse all ideals
and all desires for a "perfect" state. The modern
sage, intent on the study of material things and their
changes, confining himself to what can be seen,
heard, touched, or by instruments analysed, may have
nothing but scorn or, say, pity for one who cries out
of trouble&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Have I sinned? Yet, what have I done unto Thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">O Thou Watcher of men?<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And why wilt Thou not pardon my transgression,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And cause my sin to pass away?"<br /></span>

<p>But the man whose soul is eager in the search for
reality must endeavour to wrest from Heaven itself the
secret of his dissatisfaction with the real, his conflict
with the real, and why he must so often suffer from
the very forces that sustain his life. Yes, the passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of the soul continues. It protests against darkness,
and therefore against materialism. Conscious mind
presses toward an origin of thought. Soul must
find a Divine Eternal Soul. Where nature opens
ascending ways to the reason in its quest; where
prophets and sages have cut paths here and there
through the forest of mystery; where the brave and
true testify of a light they have seen and invite us to
follow; where One stands high and radiant above the
cross on which He suffered and declares Himself the
Resurrection and the Life,&mdash;there men will advance,
feeling themselves inspired to maintain the search
for that Eternal Truth without the hope of which
all our life here is a wearisome pageant, a troubled
dream, a bitter slavery.</p>

<p>In his reply to Eliphaz, Job first takes hold of the
charge of impatience and hasty indignation made in the
opening of the fifth chapter. He is quite aware that
his words were rash when he cursed his day and cried
impatiently for death. In accusing him of rebellious
passion, Eliphaz had shot the only arrow that went
home; and now Job, conscientious here, pulls out the
arrow to show it and the wound. "Oh," he cries,
"that my hasty passion were duly weighed, and my
misery were laid in the balance against it! For then
would it, my misery, be found heavier than the sand of
the seas: therefore have my words been rash." He is
almost deprecatory. Yes: he will admit the impatience
and vehemence with which he spoke. But then, had
Eliphaz duly considered his state, the weight of his
trouble causing a physical sense of indescribable oppression?
Let his friends look at him again, a man
prostrated with sore disease and grief, dying slowly in
the leper's exile.</p>

<span class="i0">"<i>The arrows of the Almighty are within me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The terrors of God beleaguer me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We need not fall into the mistake of supposing that
it is only the pain of his disease which makes Job's
misery so heavy. Rather is it that his troubles have
come from God; they are "the arrows of the Almighty."
Mere suffering and loss, even to the extremity of death,
he could have borne without a murmur. But he had
thought God to be his friend. Why on a sudden have
those darts been launched against him by the hand he
trusted? What does the Almighty mean? The evil-doer
who suffers knows why he is afflicted. The
martyr enduring for conscience' sake has his support
in the truth to which he bears witness, the holy cause
for which he dies. Job has no explanation, no support.
He cannot understand providence. The God with
whom he supposed himself to be at peace suddenly
becomes an angry incomprehensible Power, blighting
and destroying His servant's life. Existence poisoned,
the couch of ashes encompassed with terrors, is it any
wonder that passionate words break from his lips? A
cry is the last power left to him.</p>

<p>So it is with many. The seeming needlessness of
their sufferings, the impossibility of tracing these to
any cause in their past history, in a word, the mystery
of the pain confounds the mind, and adds to anguish
and desolation an unspeakable horror of darkness.
Sometimes the very thing guarded against is that which
happens; a man's best intelligence appears confuted by
destiny or chance. Why has he amongst the many
been chosen for this? Do all things come alike to all,
righteous and wicked? The problem becomes terribly
acute in the case of earnest God-fearing men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
women who have not yet found the real theory of
suffering. Endurance for others does not always
explain. All cannot be rested on that. Nor unless we
speak falsely for God will it avail to say, These afflictions
have fallen on us for our sins. For even if the
conscience does not give the lie to that assertion, as
Job's conscience did, the question demands a clear
answer why the penitent should suffer, those who
believe, to whom God imputes no iniquity. If it is
for our transgressions we suffer, either our own faith
and religion are vain, or God does not forgive excepting
in form, and the law of punishment retains its force.
We have here the serious difficulty that legal fictions
seem to hold their ground even in the dealings of the
Most High with those who trust Him. Many are in
the direst trouble still for the same reason as Job,
and might use his very words. Taught to believe that
suffering is invariably connected with wrong-doing and
is always in proportion to it, they cannot find in their
past life any great transgressions for which they
should be racked with constant pain or kept in grinding
penury and disappointment. Moreover, they had
imagined that through the mediation of Christ their
sins were expiated and their guilt blotted out. What
strange error is there in the creed or in the world?
Have they never believed? Has God turned against
them? So they inquire in the darkness.</p>

<p>The truth, however, as shown in a previous chapter,
is that suffering has no proportion to the guilt of sin,
but is related in the scheme of Divine providence to
life in this world, its movement, discipline, and perfecting
in the individual and the race. Afflictions,
pains, and griefs are appointed to the best as well as
the worst, because all need to be tried and urged on from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
imperfect faith and spirituality to vigour, constancy,
and courage of soul. The principle is not clearly
stated in the Book of Job, but underlies it, as truth
must underlie all genuine criticism and every faithful
picture of human life. The inspiration of the poem is
so to present the facts of human experience that the
real answer alone can satisfy. And in the speech we
are now considering some imperfect and mistaken
views are swept so completely aside that their survival
is almost unaccountable.</p>

<p>Beginning with the fifth verse we have a series of
questions somewhat difficult to interpret:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Can that be eaten which is unsavoury, without salt?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My soul refuseth to touch them;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They are to me as mouldy bread.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By some these questions are supposed to describe
sarcastically the savourless words of Eliphaz, his
"solemn and impertinent prosing." This, however,
would break the continuity of the thought. Another view
makes the reference to be to Job's afflictions, which he
is supposed to compare to insipid and loathsome food.
But it seems quite unnatural to take this as the
meaning. Such pain and grief and loss as he had
undergone were certainly not like the white of an egg.
But he has already spoken wildly, unreasonably, and
he now feels himself to be on the point of breaking out
afresh in similar impatient language. Now, the wild
ass does not complain when it has grass, nor the ox
when it has fodder; so, if his mind were supplied with
necessary explanations of the sore troubles he is
enduring, he would not be impatient, he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
complain. His soul hungers to know the reasons of
the calamities that darken his life. Nothing that has
been said helps him. Every suggestion presented to
his mind is either trifling and vain, without the salt of
wisdom, like the white of an egg, or offensive, disagreeable.
Ruthlessly sincere, he will not pretend to
be satisfied when he is not. His soul refuses to touch
the offered explanations and reasons. Verily, they are
like mouldy bread to him. It is his own impatience,
his loud cries and inquiries, he desires to account for;
he does not attack Eliphaz with sarcasm, but defends
himself.</p>

<p>At this point there is a brief halt in the speech. As
if after a pause, due to a sharp sting of pain, Job
exclaims: "Oh that God would please to destroy me!"
He had felt the paroxysm approaching; he had
endeavoured to restrain himself, but the torture drives
him, as before, to cry for death. Again and again in
the course of his speeches sudden turns of this kind
occur, points at which the dramatic feeling of the writer
comes out. He will have us remember the terrible
disease and keep continually in mind the setting of
the thoughts. Job had roused himself in beginning his
reply, and, for a little, eagerness had overcome pain.
But now he falls back, mastered by cruel sickness
which appears to be unto death. Then he speaks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Oh that I might have my request,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That God would give me the thing I long for,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Even that God would be pleased to crush me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That He would loose His hand and tear me off;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And I should yet have comfort,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I should even exult amidst unsparing pain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The longing for death which now returns on Job is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
not so passionate as before; but his cry is quite as
urgent and unqualified. As we have already seen, no
motion towards suicide is at any point of the drama
attributed to him. He does not, like Shakespeare's
Hamlet, whose position is in some respects very
similar, question with himself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And by opposing end them?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor may we say that Job is deterred from the act of
self-destruction by Hamlet's thought, "The dread of
something after death" that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"makes us rather bear those ills we have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than fly to others that we know not of."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Job has the fear and faith of God still, and not even
the pressure of "unsparing pain" can move him to
take into his own hands the ending of that torment
God bids him bear. He is too pious even to dream of
it. A true Oriental, with strong belief that the will
of God must be done, he could die without a murmur,
in more than stoical courage; but a suicide he cannot
be. And indeed the Bible, telling us for the most part
of men of healthy mind, has few suicides to record.
Saul, Zimri, Ahithophel, Judas, break away thus from
dishonour and doom; but these are all who, in
impatience and cowardice, turn against God's decree
of life.</p>

<p>Here, then, the strong religious feeling of the writer
obliges him to reject that which the poets of the world
have used to give the strongest effect to their work.
From the Greek dramatists, through Shakespeare to
Browning, the drama is full of that quarrel with life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
which flies to suicide. In this great play, as we may
well call it, of Semitic faith and genius, the ideas are
masterly, the hold of universal truth is sublime.
Perhaps the author was not fully aware of all he
suggests, but he feels that suicide serves no end: it
settles nothing; and his problem must be settled.
Suicide is an attempt at evasion in a sphere where
evasion is impossible. God and the soul have a controversy
together, and the controversy must be worked
out to an issue.</p>

<p>Job has not cursed God nor denied his words.
With this clear conscience he is not afraid to die; yet,
to keep it, he must wait on the decision of the Almighty&mdash;that
it would please God to crush him, or tear him
off like a branch from the tree of life. The prospect
of death, if it were granted by God, would revive him
for the last moment of endurance. He would leap
up to meet the stroke, God's stroke, the pledge that
God was kind to him after all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Yet the strong man must go:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the journey is done and the summit attained,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And the barriers fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The reward of it all....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And bade me creep past."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to Eliphaz there was but one way for a
sufferer. If Job would bow humbly in acknowledgment
of guilt, and seek God in penitence, then recovery
would come; the hand that smote would heal and set
him on high; all the joy and vigour of life would be
renewed, and after another long course of prosperity,
he should come to his grave at last as a shock of corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
is carried home in its season. Recalling this glib
promise, Job puts it from him as altogether incongruous
with his state. He is a leper; he is <i>dying</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>What is my strength that I should wait,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And what my term that I should be patient?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is my strength the strength of stones?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is my flesh brass?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is not my help within me gone,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And energy quite driven from me?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why, his condition is hopeless. What can he look
for but death? Speak to him of a new term; it was
adding mockery to despair. But he would die still true
to God, and therefore he seeks the end of conflict.
If he were to live on he could not be sure of himself,
especially when, with failing strength, he had to endure
the nausea and stings of disease. As yet he can face
death as a chief should.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The second part of the address begins at the fourteenth
verse of chap. vi. Here Job rouses himself
anew, and this time to assail his friends. The language
of their spokesman had been addressed to him from
a height of assumed moral superiority, and this had
stirred in Job a resentment quite natural. No doubt
the three friends showed friendliness. He could not
forget the long journey they had made to bring him
comfort. But when he bethought him how in his
prosperity he had often entertained these men, held
high discourse with them on the ways of God, opened
his heart and showed them all his life, he marvelled
that now they could fail of the thing he most wanted&mdash;understanding.
The knowledge they had of him
should have made suspicion impossible, for they had
the testimony of his whole life. The author is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
unfair to his champions of orthodoxy. They fail where
all such have a way of failing. If their victim in the poem
presses on to stinging sarcasm and at last oversteps
the bounds of fair criticism, one need not wonder. He
is not intended as a type of the meek, self-depreciating
person who lets slander pass without a protest. If
they have treated him badly, he will tell them to their
faces what he thinks. Their want of justice might
cause a weak man to slip and lose himself.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Pity from his friend is due to the despairing,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But my brethren have deceived as a torrent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Like the streams of the ravine, that pass away,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That become blackish with ice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In which the snow is dissolved.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>What time they wax warm they vanish,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When it is hot they are dried up out of their place.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The caravans turn aside,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They go up into the desert and are perishing.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The caravans of Tema look out,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The merchants of Sheba hope for them.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They were ashamed because they had trusted,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They came up to them and blushed.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Even so, now are ye nought.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poetical genius of the writer overflows here.
The allegory is beautiful, the wit keen, the knowledge
abundant; yet, in a sense, we have to pardon the
interposition. Job is not quite in the mood to represent
his disappointment by such an elaborate picture.
He would naturally seek a sharper mode of expression.
Still, the passage must not be judged by our modern
dramatic rules. This is the earliest example of the
philosophic story, and elaborate word-pictures are part
of the literature of the piece. We accept the pleasure
of following a description which Job must be supposed
to have painted in melancholy humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene is in the desert, several days' journey from
the Jauf, that valley already identified as the region
in which Job lived. Beyond the Nefood to the west
towers the Jebel Tobeyk, a high ridge covered in
winter with deep snow, the melting of which fills the
ravines with roaring streams. Caravans are coming
across the desert from Tema, which lies seven days'
journey to the south of the Jauf, and from Sheba still
farther in the same direction. They are on the march
in early summer and, falling short of water, turn aside
westward to one of the ravines where a stream is expected
to be still flowing. But, alas for the vain hope!
In the wadi is nothing but stones and dry sand, mocking
the thirst of man and beast. Even so, says Job to his
friends, ye are treacherous; ye are nothing. I looked
for the refreshing water of sympathy, but ye are empty
ravines, dry sand. In my days of prosperity you
gushed with friendliness. Now, when I thirst, ye have
not even pity. "Ye see a terror, and are afraid." I
am terribly stricken. You fear that if you sympathised
with me, you might provoke the anger of God.</p>

<p>From this point he turns upon them with reproach.
Had he asked them for anything, gifts out of their
herds or treasure, aid in recovering his property?
They knew he had requested no such service. But
again and again Eliphaz had made the suggestion that
he was suffering as a wrong-doer. Would they tell
him then, straightforwardly, how and when he had
transgressed? "How forcible are words of uprightness,"
words that go right to a point; but as for their
reproving, what did it come to? They had caught at
his complaint. Men of experience should know that
the talk of a desperate man is for the wind, to be blown
away and forgotten, not to be laid hold of captiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
And here from sarcasm he passes to invective. Their
temper, he tells them, is so hard and unfeeling that
they are fit to cast lots over the orphan and bargain
over a friend. They would be guilty even of selling
for a slave a poor fatherless child cast on their charity.
"Be pleased to look on me," he cries; "I surely will
not lie to your face. Return, let not wrong be done.
Go back over my life. Let there be no unfairness.
Still is my cause just." They were bound to admit
that he was as able to distinguish right from wrong as
they were. If that were not granted, then his whole
life went for nothing, and their friendship also.</p>

<p>In this vivid eager expostulation there is at least
much of human nature. It abounds in natural touches
common to all time and in shrewd ironic perception.
The sarcasms of Job bear not only upon his friends,
but also upon our lives. The words of men who are
sorely tossed with trouble, aye even their deeds, are to
be judged with full allowance for circumstances. A
man driven back inch by inch in a fight with the world,
irritated by defeat, thwarted in his plans, missing his
calculations, how easy is it to criticise him from the
standpoint of a successful career, high repute, a good
balance at the banker's! The hasty words of one who
is in sore distress, due possibly to his own ignorance
and carelessness, how easy to reckon them against him,
find in them abundant proof that he is an unbeliever
and a knave, and so pass on to offer in the temple the
Pharisee's prayer! But, easy and natural, it is base.
The author of our poem does well to lay the lash of
his inspired scorn upon such a temper. He who stores
in memory the quick words of a sufferer and brings
them up by and by to prove him deserving of all his
troubles, such a man would cast lots over the orphan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
It is no unfair charge. Oh for humane feeling, gentle
truth, self-searching fear of falsehood! It is so easy
to be hard and pious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beginning another strophe Job turns from his friends,
from would-be wise assertions and innuendoes, to find, if
he can, a philosophy of human life, then to reflect once
more in sorrow on his state, and finally to wrestle in
urgent entreaty with the Most High. The seventh
chapter, in which we trace this line of thought, increases
in pathos as it proceeds and rises to the climax
of a most daring demand which is not blasphemous
because it is entirely frank, profoundly earnest.</p>

<p>The friends of Job have wondered at his sufferings.
He himself has tried to find the reason of them. Now
he seeks it again in a survey of man's life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Hath not man war service on earth?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And as the days of an hireling are not his?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The thought of necessity is coming over Job, that man
is not his own master; that a Power he cannot resist
appoints his task, whether of action or endurance, to
fight in the hot battle or to suffer wearily. And there
is truth in the conception; only it is a truth which is
inspiring or depressing as the ultimate Power is found
in noble character or mindless force. In the time of
prosperity this thought of an inexorable decree would
have caused no perplexity to Job, and his judgment
would have been that the Irresistible is wise and kind.
But now, because the shadow has fallen, all appears in
gloomy colour, and man's life a bitter servitude. As
a slave, panting for the shade, longing to have his
work over, Job considers man. During months of
vanity and nights of weariness he waits, long nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
made dreary with pain, through the slow hours of
which he tosses to and fro in misery. His flesh is
clothed with worms and an earthy crust, his skin
hardens and breaks out. His days are flimsier than a
web (ver. 6), and draw to a close without hope. The
wretchedness masters him, and he cries to God.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>O remember, a breath is my life;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Never again will mine eye see good.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does the Almighty consider how little time is left to
him? Surely a gleam might break before all grows
dark! Out of sight he will be soon, yea, out of the
sight of God Himself, like a cloud that melts away.
His place will be down in Sheol, the region of mere
existence, not of life, where a man's being dissolves
in shadows and dreams. God must know this is
coming to Job. Yet in anguish, ere he die, he will
remonstrate with his Maker: "I will not curb my
mouth, I will make my complaint in the bitterness of
my soul."</p>

<p>Striking indeed is the remonstrance that follows.
A struggle against that belief in grim fate which has
so injured Oriental character gives vehemence to his
appeal; for God must not be lost. His mind is
represented as going abroad to find in nature what is
most ungovernable and may be supposed to require
most surveillance and restraint. By change after
change, stroke after stroke, his power has been curbed;
till at last, in abject impotence, he lies, a wreck upon
the wayside. Nor is he allowed the last solace of
nature <i>in extremis</i>; he is not unconscious; he cannot
sleep away his misery. By night tormenting dreams
haunt him, and visions make as it were a terrible wall
against him. He exists on sufferance, perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
chafed. With all this in his consciousness, he
asks,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That thou keepest watch over me?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a daring figure he imagines the Most High who
sets a bound to the sea exercising the same restraint
over him, or barring his way as if he were some huge
monster of the deep. A certain grim humour characterises
the picture. His friends have denounced his impetuosity.
Is it as fierce in God's sight? Can his rage
be so wild? Strange indeed is the restraint put on one
conscious of having sought to serve God and his age.
In self-pity, with an inward sense of the absurdity of
the notion, he fancies the Almighty fencing his squalid
couch with the horrible dreams and spectres of delirium,
barring his way as if he were a raging flood. "I
loathe life," he cries; "I would not live always. Let
me alone, for my days are a vapour." Do not pain me
and hem me in with Thy terrors that allow no freedom,
no hope, nothing but a weary sense of impotence.
And then his expostulation becomes even bolder.</p>

<p>"What is man," asks a psalmist, "that Thou art
mindful of him, and the son of man, that Thou visitest
him?" With amazement God's thought of so puny and
insignificant a being is observed. But Job, marking in
like manner the littleness of man, turns the question
in another way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>What is man that Thou magnifiest him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And settest Thine heart upon him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That Thou visitest him every morning,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And triest him every moment?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Has the Almighty no greater thing to engage Him
that He presses hard on the slight personality of man?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Might he not be let alone for a little? Might the
watchful eye not be turned away from him even for
a moment?</p>

<p>And finally, coming to the supposition that he may
have transgressed and brought himself under the judgment
of the Most High, he even dares to ask why that
should be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Have I sinned? Yet what have I done unto Thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>O Thou Watcher of men?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Why hast Thou set me as Thy butt,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>So that I am a burden to myself?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And why wilt Thou not pardon my transgression,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And cause my sin to pass away?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How can his sin have injured God? Far above
man the Almighty dwells and reigns. No shock of
human revolt can affect His throne. Strange is it that
a man, even if he has committed some fault or neglected
some duty, should be like a block of wood or stone
before the feet of the Most High, till bruised and broken
he cares no more for existence. If iniquity has been
done, cannot the Great God forgive it, pass it by?
That would be more like the Great God. Yes; soon
Job would be down in the dust of death. The Almighty
would find then that he had gone too far. "Thou
shalt seek me, but I shall not be."</p>

<p>More daring words were never put by a pious man
into the mouth of one represented as pious; and the
whole passage shows how daring piety may be. The
inspired writer of this book knows God too well,
honours Him too profoundly to be afraid. The Eternal
Father does not watch keenly for the offences of the
creatures He has made. May a man not be frank with
God and say out what is in his heart? Surely he may.
But he must be entirely earnest. No one playing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
life, with duty, with truth, or with doubt may expostulate
thus with his Maker.</p>

<p>There is indeed an aspect of our little life in which
sin may appear too pitiful, too impotent for God to
search out. "As for man, his days are as grass; as a
flower of the field, so he flourisheth." Only when we
see that infinite Justice is involved in the minute
infractions of justice, that it must redress the iniquity
done by feeble hands and vindicate the ideal we crave for
yet so often infringe; only when we see this and realise
therewith the greatness of our being, made for justice
and the ideal, for moral conflict and victory; only, in
short, when we know responsibility, do we stand aghast
at sin and comprehend the meaning of judgment. Job
is learning here the wisdom and holiness of God which
stand correlative to His grace and our responsibility.
By way of trial and pain and these sore battles with
doubt he is entering into the fulness of the heritage of
spiritual knowledge and power.</p>

<p class="center"><i>VENTURESOME THEOLOGY.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Bildad speaks. Chap.</span> viii.</p>


<p>The first attempt to meet Job has been made by
one who relies on his own experience and takes
pleasure in recounting the things which he has seen.
Bildad of Shuach, on the other hand, is a man who
holds to the wisdom of the fathers and supports
himself at all times with their answers to the questions
of life. Vain to him is the reasoning of one who sees
all as through coloured glass, everything of this tint
or that, according to his state or notions for the time
being. The personal impression counts for nothing
with Bildad. He finds no authority there. In him we
have the catholic theologian opposing individualism.
Unfortunately he fails in the power most needed, of
distinguishing chaff from grain. Back to antiquity,
back to the fathers, say some; but, although they profess
the excellent temper of reverence, there is no guarantee
that they will not select the follies of the past instead
of its wisdom to admire. Everything depends upon
the man, the individual, after all, whether he has an
open mind, a preference if not a passion for great
ideas. There are those who go back to the apostles
and find only dogmatism, instead of the glorious breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of Divine poetry and hope. Yea, some go to the Light
of the World, and report as their discovery some pragmatical
scheme, some weak arrangement of details, a
bondage or a futility. Bildad is not one of these.
He is intelligent and well-informed, an able man,
as we say; but he has no sympathy with new ideas
that burst the old wine-skins of tradition, no sympathy
with daring words that throw doubt on old orthodoxies.
You can fancy his pious horror when the
rude hand of Job seemed to rend the sacred garments
of established truth. It would have been like him to
turn away and leave to fate and judgment a man so
venturesome.</p>

<p>With the instinct of the highest and noblest thought,
utterly removed from all impiety, the writer has shown
his inspiration in leading Job to a climax of impassioned
inquiry as one who wrestles in the swellings of Jordan
with the angel of Jehovah. Now he brings forward
Bildad speaking cold words from a mind quite unable
to understand the crisis. This is a man who firmly
believed himself possessed of authority and insight.
When Job added entreaty to entreaty, demand to
demand, Bildad would feel as if his ears were deceiving
him, for what he heard seemed to be an impious
assault on the justice of the Most High, an attempt to
convict the Infinitely Righteous of unrighteousness.
He burns to speak; and Job has no sooner sunk down
exhausted than he begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>How long wilt thou speak these things?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>A mighty wind, forsooth, are the words of thy mouth.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>God:&mdash;will He pervert judgment?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Almighty God:&mdash;will He pervert righteousness?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thy children sinned against Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He cast them away into the hand of their rebellion;</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thou wilt seek unto God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And unto the Almighty wilt make entreaty;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If spotless and upright thou art,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Surely now He would awake for thee</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And make prosperous thy righteous habitation.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>So that thy beginning shall prove small</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thy latter end exceedingly great.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How far wrong Bildad is may be seen in this, that
he dangles before Job the hope of greater worldly
prosperity. The children must have sinned, for they
have perished. Yet Job himself may possibly be
innocent. If he is, then a simple entreaty to God will
insure His renewed favour and help. Job is required to
seek wealth and greatness again as a pledge of his own
uprightness. But the whole difficulty lies in the fact
that, being upright, he has been plunged into poverty,
desolation, and a living death. He desires to know the
reason of what has occurred. Apart altogether from
the restoration of his prosperity and health, he would
know what God means. Bildad does not see this in
the least. Himself a prosperous man, devoted to the
doctrine that opulence is the proof of religious acceptance
and security, he has nothing for Job but the
advice to get God to prove him righteous by giving
him back his goods. There is a taunt in Bildad's
speech. He privately believes that there has been sin,
and that only by way of repentance good can come
again. Since his friend is so obstinate let him try
to regain his prosperity and fail. Bildad is lavish
in promises, extravagant indeed. He can only be
acquitted of a sinister meaning in his large prediction
if we judge that he reckons God to be under a debt
to a faithful servant whom He had unwittingly, while
He was not observing, allowed to be overtaken by
disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Next the speaker parades his learning, the wisdom
he had gathered from the past:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Inquire, I pray thee, of the bygone age,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And attend to the research of their fathers.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>(For we are but of yesterday and know nothing;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>A shadow, indeed, are our days upon the earth)&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Shall not they teach thee and tell thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Bring forth words from their heart?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The man of to-day is nothing, a poor creature. Only
by the proved wisdom of the long ages can end come to
controversy. Let Job listen, then, and be convinced.</p>

<p>Now it must be owned there is not simply an air of
truth but truth itself in what Bildad proceeds to say
in the very picturesque passage that follows. Truths,
however, may be taken hold of in a wrong way to
establish false conclusions; and in this way Job's interlocutor
errs with not a few of his painstaking successors.
The rush or papyrus of the river-side cannot grow
without mire; the reed-grass needs moisture. If the
water fails they wither. So are the paths of all that
forget God. Yes: if you take it aright, what can be
more impressively certain? The hope of a godless
man perishes. His confidence is cut off; it is as if he
trusted in a spider's web. Even his house, however
strongly built, shall not support him. The man who
has abandoned God must come to this&mdash;that every
earthly stay shall snap asunder, every expectation fade.
There shall be nothing between him and despair. His
strength, his wisdom, his inheritance, his possessions
piled together in abundance, how can they avail when
the demand is urged by Divine justice&mdash;What hast thou
done with thy life? This, however, is not at all in
Bildad's mind. He is not thinking of the prosperity of
the soul and exultation in God, but of outward success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
that a man should spread his visible existence like a
green bay tree. Beyond that visible existence he cannot
stretch thought or reasoning. His school, generally,
believed in God much after the manner of English
eighteenth-century deists, standing on the earth, looking
over the life of man here, and demanding in the present
world the vindication of providence. The position is
realistic, the good of life solely mundane. If one is
brought low who flourished in luxuriance and sent
forth his shoots over the garden and was rooted near
the spring, his poverty is his destruction; he is
destroyed because somehow the law of life, that is of
prosperity, has been transgressed, and the God of
success punishes the fault. We are made to feel that
beneath the promise of returning honour and joy with
which Bildad closes there is an <i>if</i>. "God will not cast
away a perfect man." Is Job perfect? Then his mouth
will be filled with laughter, and his haters shall be
clothed with shame. That issue is problematical. And
yet, on the whole, doubt is kept well in the background,
and the final word of cheer is made as generous and
hopeful as circumstances will allow. Bildad means to
leave the impression on Job's mind that the wisdom of
the ancients as applied to his case is reassuring.</p>

<p>But one sentence of his speech, that in which (ver. 4)
he implies the belief that Job's children had sinned and
been "cast away into the hand of their rebellion," shows
the cold, relentless side of his orthodoxy, the logic, not
unknown still, which presses to its point over the whole
human race. Bildad meant, it appears, to shift from
Job the burden of his children's fate. The catastrophe
which overtook them might have seemed to be one of the
arrows of judgment aimed at the father. Job himself
may have had great perplexity as well as keen distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
whenever he thought of his sons and daughters. Now
Bildad is throwing on them the guilt which he believes
to have been so terribly punished, even to the extremity
of irremediable death. But there is no enlightenment
in the suggestion. Rather does it add to the difficulties
of the case. The sons and daughters whom Job loved,
over whom he watched with such religious care lest they
should renounce God in their hearts&mdash;were they condemned
by the Most High? A man of the old world,
accustomed to think of himself as standing in God's
stead to his household, Job cannot receive this. Thought
having been once stirred to its depths, he is resentful
now against a doctrine that may never before have
been questioned. Is there, then, no fatherhood in the
Almighty, no magnanimity such as Job himself would
have shown? If so, then the spirit would fail before
Him, and the souls which He has made (Isaiah lvii. 16).
The dogmatist with his wisdom of the ages drops in
the by-going one of his commonplaces of theological
thought. It is a coal of fire in the heart of the sufferer.</p>

<p>Those who attempt to explain God's ways for edification
and comfort need to be very simple and genuine
in their feeling with men, their effort on behalf of God.
Every one who believes and thinks has something in
his spiritual experience worth recounting, and may help
an afflicted brother by retracing his own history. But
to make a creed learned by rote the basis of consolation
is perilous. The aspect it takes to those under trial
will often surprise the best-meaning consoler. A point
is emphasised by the keen mind of sorrow, and, like
Elijah's cloud, it soon sweeps over the whole sky, a
storm of doubt and dismay.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE THOUGHT OF A DAYSMAN.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chaps.</span> ix., x.</p>


<p>It is with an infinitely sad restatement of what God
has been made to appear to him by Bildad's speech
that Job begins his reply. Yes, yes; it is so. How
can man be just before such a God? You tell me my
children are overwhelmed with destruction for their
sins. You tell me that I, who am not quite dead as
yet, may have new prosperity if I put myself into right
relations with God. But how can that be? There is
no uprightness, no dutifulness, no pious obedience, no
sacrifice that will satisfy Him. I did my utmost; yet
God has condemned me. And if He is what you say,
His condemnation is unanswerable. He has such
wisdom in devising accusations and in maintaining
them against feeble man, that hope there can be none
for any human being. To answer one of the thousand
charges God can bring, if He will contend with man,
is impossible. The earthquakes are signs of His indignation,
removing mountains, shaking the earth out of
her place. He is able to quench the light of the sun
and moon, and to seal up the stars. What is man
beside the omnipotence of Him who alone stretched
out the heavens, whose march is on the huge waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the ocean, who is the Creator of the constellations'
the Bear, the Giant, the Pleiades, and the chambers or
spaces of the southern sky? It is the play of irresistible
power Job traces around him, and the Divine
mind or will is inscrutable.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Lo, He goeth by me and I see Him not:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He passeth on, and I perceive Him not.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold, He seizeth. Who will stay Him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who will say to Him, What doest Thou?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Step by step the thought here advances into that
dreadful imagination of God's unrighteousness which
must issue in revolt or in despair. Job, turning against
the bitter logic of tradition, appears for the time to
plunge into impiety. Sincere earnest thinker as he is,
he falls into a strain we are almost compelled to call
false and blasphemous. Bildad and Eliphaz seem to
be saints, Job a rebel against God. The Almighty,
he says, is like a lion that seizes the prey and cannot
be hindered from devouring. He is a wrathful tyrant
under whom the helpers of Rahab, those powers that
according to some nature myth sustain the dragon of
the sea in its conflict with heaven, stoop and give
way. Shall Job essay to answer Him? It is vain.
He cannot. To choose words in such a controversy
would be of no avail. Even one right in his cause
would be overborne by tyrannical omnipotence. He
would have no resource but to supplicate for mercy
like a detected malefactor. Once Job may have thought
that an appeal to justice would be heard, that his trust
in righteousness was well founded. He is falling away
from that belief now. This being whose despotic power
has been set in his view has no sense of man's right.
He cares nothing for man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>What is God? How does He appear in the light
of the sufferings of Job?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He breaketh me with a tempest,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Increaseth my wounds without cause.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If you speak of the strength of the mighty,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i15"><i>'Behold Me,' saith He;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If of judgment&mdash;'Who will appoint Me a time?'</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No one, that is, can call God to account. The temper
of the Almighty appears to Job to be such that man
must needs give up all controversy. In his heart Job
is convinced still that he has wrought no evil. But
he will not say so. He will anticipate the wilful condemnation
of the Almighty. God would assail his life.
Job replies in fierce revolt, "Assail it, take it away,
I care not, for I despise it. Whether one is righteous
or evil, it is all the same. God destroys the perfect
and the wicked" (ver. 22).</p>

<p>Now, are we to explain away this language? If not,
how shall we defend the writer who has put it into the
mouth of one still the hero of the book, still appearing
as a friend of God? To many in our day, as of old,
religion is so dull and lifeless, their desire for the
friendship of God so lukewarm, that the passion of the
words of Job is incomprehensible to them. His courage
of despair belongs to a range of feeling they never
entered, never dreamt of entering. The calculating
world is their home, and in its frigid atmosphere there
is no possibility of that keen striving for spiritual life
which fills the soul as with fire. To those who deny
sin and pooh-pooh anxiety about the soul, the book
may well appear an old-world dream, a Hebrew allegory
rather than the history of a man. But the language of
Job is no outburst of lawlessness; it springs out of deep
and serious thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to find an exact modern parallel here;
but we have not to go far back for one who was
driven like Job by false theology into bewilderment,
something like unreason. In his "Grace Abounding,"
John Bunyan reveals the depths of fear into which
hard arguments and misinterpretations of Scripture
often plunged him, when he should have been rejoicing
in the liberty of a child of God. The case of Bunyan
is, in a sense, very different from that of Job. Yet both
are urged almost to despair of God; and Bunyan,
realising this point of likeness, again and again uses
words put into Job's mouth. Doubts and suspicions
are suggested by his reading, or by sermons which he
hears, and he regards their occurrence to his mind as
a proof of his wickedness. In one place he says:
"Now I thought surely I am possessed of the devil:
at other times again I thought I should be bereft of
my wits; for, instead of lauding and magnifying God
with others, if I have but heard Him spoken of,
presently some most horrible blasphemous thought or
other would bolt out of my heart against Him, so that
whether I did think that God was, or again did think
there was no such thing, no love, nor peace, nor gracious
disposition could I feel within me." Bunyan had a
vivid imagination. He was haunted by strange cravings
for the spiritually adventurous. What would it
be to sin the sin that is unto death? "In so strong a
measure," he says, "was this temptation upon me, that
often I have been ready to clap my hands under my
chin to keep my mouth from opening." The idea that
he should "sell and part with Christ" was one that
terribly afflicted him; and, "at last," he says, "after
much striving, I felt this thought pass through my
heart, Let Him go if He will.... After this, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
for two years together would abide with me but damnation
and the expectation of damnation. This thought
had passed my heart&mdash;God hath let me go, and I am
fallen. Oh, thought I, that it was with me as in
months past, as in the days when God preserved me."</p>

<p>The Book of Job helps us to understand Bunyan
and those terrors of his that amaze our composed
generation. Given a man like Job or like Bunyan, to
whom religion is everything, who must feel sure of
Divine justice, truth, and mercy, he will pass far beyond
the measured emotions and phrases of those who are
more than half content with the world and themselves.
The writer here, whose own stages of thought are
recorded, and Bunyan, who with rare force and sincerity
retraces the way of his life, are men of splendid character
and virtue. Titans of the religious life, they are stricken
with anguish and bound with iron fetters to the rock
of pain for the sake of universal humanity. They are
a wonder to the worldling, they speak in terms the
smooth professor of religion shudders at. But their endurance,
their vehement resolution, break the falsehoods
of the time and enter into the redemption of the race.</p>

<p>The strain of Job's complaint increases in bitterness.
He seems to see omnipotent injustice everywhere. If
a scourge (ver. 23), such as lightning, accident or disease,
slayeth suddenly, there seems to be nothing but
mockery of the innocent. God looks down on the
wreck of human hope from the calm sky after the
thunderstorm, in the evening sunlight that gilds the desert
grave. And in the world of men the wicked have their
way. God veils the face of the judge so that he is
blinded to the equity of the cause. Thus, after the
arguments of his friends, Job is compelled to see wrong
everywhere, and to say that it is the doing of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
The strophe ends with the abrupt fierce demand,&mdash;If
not, who then is it?</p>

<p>The short passage from the twenty-fifth verse to the
end of chap. ix. returns sadly to the strain of personal
weakness and entreaty. Swiftly Job's days go by,
more swiftly than a runner, in so far as he sees no
good. Or they are like the reed-skiffs on the river,
or the darting eagle. To forget his pain is impossible.
He cannot put on an appearance of serenity or hope.
God is keeping him bound as a transgressor. "I shall
be condemned whatever I do. Why then do I weary
myself in vain?" Looking at his discoloured body,
covered with the grime of disease, he finds it a sign
of God's detestation. But if he could wash it with
snow, that is, to snowy whiteness, if he could purify
those blackened limbs with lye, the renewal would go
no further. God would plunge him again into the
mire; his own clothes would abhor him.</p>

<p>And now there is a change of tone. His mind,
revolting from its own conclusion, turns toward the
thought of reconciliation. While as yet he speaks of
it as an impossibility there comes to him a sorrowful
regret, a vague dream or reflection in place of that
fierce rebellion which discoloured the whole world and
made it appear an arena of injustice. With that he
cannot pretend to satisfy himself. Again his humanity
stirs in him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For He is not a man, as I, that I should answer Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That we should come together in judgment.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>There is no daysman between us</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That might lay his hand upon us both.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Let Him take away His rod from me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And let not His terror overawe me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then would I speak and not fear Him:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I am not in such case in myself.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></div></div>

<p>If he could only speak with God as a man speaks with
his friend the shadows might be cleared away. The
real God, not unreasonable, not unrighteous nor despotic,
here begins to appear; and in default of personal
converse, and of a daysman, or arbiter, who might lay
reconciling hands upon both and bring them together,
Job cries for an interval of strength and freedom, that
without fear and anguish he may himself express the
matter at stake. The idea of a daysman, although the
possibility of such a friendly helper is denied, is a new
mark of boldness in the thought of the drama. In
that one word the inspired writer strikes the note of
a Divine purpose which he does not yet foresee. We
must not say that here we have the prediction of a
Redeemer at once God and man. The author has no
such affirmation to make. But very remarkably the
desires of Job are led forth in that direction in which
the advent and work of Christ have fulfilled the decree
of grace. There can be no doubt of the inspiration of
a writer who thus strikes into the current of the Divine
will and revelation. Not obscurely is it implied in this
Book of Job that, however earnest man may be in
religion, however upright and faithful (for all this Job
was), there are mysteries of fear and sorrow connected
with his life in this world which can be solved only by
One who brings the light of eternity into the range of
time, who is at once "very God and very man," whose
overcoming demands and encourages our faith.</p>

<p>Now, the wistful cry of Job&mdash;"There is no daysman
between us"&mdash;breaking from the depths of an experience
to which the best as well as the worst are exposed
in this life, an experience which cannot in either case
be justified or accounted for unless by the fact of
immortality, is, let us say, as presented here, a purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
human cry. Man who "cannot be God's exile," bound
always to seek understanding of the will and character
of God, finds himself in the midst of sudden calamity
and extreme pain, face to face with death. The darkness
that shrouds his whole existence he longs to see
dispelled or shot through with beams of clear revealing
light. What shall we say of it? If such a desire,
arising in the inmost mind, had no correspondence
whatever to fact, there would be falsehood at the heart
of things. The very shape the desire takes&mdash;for a
Mediator who should be acquainted equally with God
and man, sympathetic toward the creature, knowing
the mind of the Creator&mdash;cannot be a chance thing.
It is the fruit of a Divine necessity inwrought with
the constitution and life of the human soul. We are
pointed to an irrefragable argument; but the thought
meanwhile does not follow it. Immortality waits for
a revelation.</p>

<p>Job has prayed for rest. It does not come. Another
attack of pain makes a pause in his speech, and with
the tenth chapter begins a long address to the Most
High, not fierce as before, but sorrowful, subdued.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>My soul is weary of my life.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I will give free course to my complaint;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I will speak in bitterness of my soul.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is scarcely possible to touch the threnody that
follows without marring its pathetic and profound
beauty. There is an exquisite dignity of restraint and
frankness in this appeal to the Creator. He is an
Artist whose fine work is in peril, and that from His
own seeming carelessness of it, or more dreadful to
conceive, His resolution to destroy it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>First the cry is, "Do not condemn me. Is it good
unto Thee that Thou shouldest despise the work of
Thine hands?" It is marvellous to Job that he should
be scorned as worthless, while at the same time God
seems to shine on the counsel of the wicked. How can
that, O Thou Most High, be in harmony with Thy
nature? He puts a supposition, which even in stating
it he must refuse, "Hast Thou eyes of flesh? or seest
Thou as man seeth?" A jealous man, clothed with
a little brief authority, might probe into the misdeeds
of a fellow-creature. But God cannot do so. His
majesty forbids; and especially since He knows, for one
thing, that Job is not guilty, and, for another thing,
that no one can escape His hands. Men often lay hold
of the innocent, and torture them to discover imputed
crimes. The supposition that God acts like a despot
or the servant of a despot is made only to be cast aside.
But he goes back on his appeal to God as Creator, and
bethinks him of that tender fashioning of the body
which seems an argument for as tender a care of the
soul and the spirit-life. Much of power and lovingkindness
goes to the perfecting of the body and the
development of the physical life out of weakness and
embryonic form. Can He who has so wrought, who
has added favour and apparent love, have been concealing
all the time a design of mockery? Even in creating,
had God the purpose of making His creature a mere
plaything for the self-will of Omnipotence?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Yet these things Thou didst hide in Thine heart.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These things&mdash;the desolate home, the outcast life,
the leprosy. Job uses a strange word: "I <i>know</i> that
this was with Thee." His conclusion is stated roughly,
that nothing can matter in dealing with such a Creator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
The insistence of the friends on the hope of forgiveness,
Job's own consciousness of integrity go for nothing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Were I to sin Thou wouldst mark me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And Thou wouldst not acquit me of iniquity.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Were I wicked, woe unto me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Were I righteous, yet should I not lift up my head.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The supreme Power of the world has taken an aspect
not of unreasoning force, but of determined ill-will to
man. The only safety seems to be in lying quiet so as
not to excite against him the activity of this awful God
who hunts like a lion and delights in marvels of wasteful
strength. It appears that, having been once roused, the
Divine Enemy will not cease to persecute. New witnesses,
new causes of indignation would be found; a
changing host of troubles would follow up the attack.</p>

<p>I have ventured to interpret the whole address in
terms of supposition, as a theory Job flings out in the
utter darkness that surrounds him. He does not adopt
it. To imagine that he really believes this, or that the
writer of the book intended to put forward such a theory
as even approximately true, is quite impossible. And
yet, when one thinks of it, perhaps impossible is too
strong a word. The doctrine of the sovereignty of God
is a fundamental truth; but it has been so conceived
and wrought with as to lead many reasoners into a
dream of cruelty and irresponsible force not unlike that
which haunts the mind of Job. Something of the kind
has been argued for with no little earnestness by men
who were religiously endeavouring to explain the Bible
and professed to believe in the love of God to the
world. For example: the annihilation of the wicked
is denied by one for the good reason that God has a
profound reverence for being or existence, so that he
who is once possessed of will must exist for ever; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
from this the writer goes on to maintain that the wicked
are useful to God as the material on which His justice
operates, that indeed they have been created solely for
everlasting punishment in order that through them the
justice of the Almighty may be clearly seen. Against
this very kind of theology Job is in revolt. In the light
even of his world it was a creed of darkness. That God
hates wrong-doing, that everything selfish, vindictive,
cruel, unclean, false, shall be driven before Him&mdash;who
can doubt? That according to His decree sin brings
its punishment yielding the wages of death&mdash;who can
doubt? But to represent Him who has made us all,
and must have foreseen our sin, as without any kind of
responsibility for us, dashing in pieces the machines
He has made because they do not serve His purpose,
though He knew even in making them that they would
not&mdash;what a hideous falsehood is this; it can justify
God only at the expense of undeifying Him.</p>

<p>One thing this Book of Job teaches, that we are not
to go against our own sincere reason nor our sense of
justice and truth in order to square facts with any
scheme or any theory. Religious teaching and thought
must affirm nothing that is not entirely frank, purely
just, and such as we could, in the last resort, apply out
and out to ourselves. Shall man be more just than
God, more generous than God, more faithful than God?
Perish the thought, and every system that maintains so
false a theory and tries to force it on the human mind!
Nevertheless, let there be no falling into the opposite
error; from that, too, frankness will preserve us. No
sincere man, attentive to the realities of the world and
the awful ordinances of nature, can suspect the Universal
Power of indifference to evil, of any design to leave law
without sanction. We do not escape at one point;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
God is our Father; righteousness is vindicated, and so
is faith.</p>

<p>As the colloquies proceed, the impression is gradually
made that the writer of this book is wrestling with that
study which more and more engages the intellect of
man&mdash;What is the real? How does it stand related
to the ideal, thought of as righteousness, as beauty, as
truth? How does it stand related to God, sovereign
and holy? The opening of the book might have led
straight to the theory that the real, the present world
charged with sin, disaster, and death, is not of the
Divine order, therefore is of a Devil. But the disappearance
of Satan throws aside any such idea of
dualism, and pledges the writer to find solution, if he
find it at all, in one will, one purpose, one Divine event.
On Job himself the burden and the effort descend in
his conflict with the real as disaster, enigma, impending
death, false judgment, established theology and schemes
of explanation. The ideal evades him, is lost between
the rising wave and the lowering sky. In the whole
horizon he sees no clear open space where it can
unfold the day. But it remains in his heart; and in the
night-sky it waits where the great constellations shine
in their dazzling purity and eternal calm, brooding
silent over the world as from immeasurable distance far
withdrawn. Even from that distance God sends forth
and will accomplish a design. Meanwhile the man
stretches his hands in vain from the shadowed earth to
those keen lights, ever so remote and cold.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><i>A FRESH ATTEMPT TO CONVICT.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Zophar speaks. Chap.</span> xi.</p>


<p>The third and presumably youngest of the three
friends of Job now takes up the argument somewhat
in the same strain as the others. With no wish
to be unfair to Zophar we are somewhat prepossessed
against him from the outset; and the writer must
mean us to be so, since he makes him attack Job as an
empty babbler:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Shall not the multitude of words be answered?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And shall a man of lips be justified?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Shall thy boastings make people silent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>So that thou mayest mock on, none putting thee to shame?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>True it was, Job had used vehement speech. Yet it
is a most insulting suggestion that he meant little but
irreligious bluster. The special note of Zophar comes
out in his rebuke of Job for the mockery, that is,
sceptical talk, in which he had indulged. Persons who
merely rehearse opinions are usually the most dogmatic
and take most upon them. Nobody reckons himself
more able to detect error in doctrine, nobody denounces
rationalism and infidelity with greater confidence, than
the man whose creed is formal, who never applied his
mind directly to the problems of faith, and has but a
moderate amount of mind to apply. Zophar, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
is a man of considerable intelligence; but he betrays
himself. To him Job's words have been wearisome.
He may have tried to understand the matter, but he
has caught only a general impression that, in the face
of what appears to him clearest evidence, Job denies
being any way amenable to justice. He had dared to
say to God, "Thou knowest that I am not wicked."
What? God can afflict a man whom He knows to be
righteous! It is a doctrine as profane as it is novel.
Eliphaz and Bildad supposed that they had to deal
with a man unwilling to humble himself in the way of
acknowledging sins hitherto concealed. By pressure
of one kind or another they hoped to get Job to realise
his secret transgression. But Zophar has noted the
whole tendency of his argument to be heretical.
"Thou sayest, My doctrine is pure." And what is
that doctrine? Why, that thou wast clean in the eyes
of God, that God has smitten thee without cause.
Dost thou mean, O Job! to accuse the Most High of
acting in that manner? Oh that God would speak and
open His lips against thee! Thou hast expressed a
desire to state thy case to Him. The result would be
very different from thy expectation.</p>

<p>Now, beneath any mistaken view held by sincere
persons there is almost always a sort of foundation of
truth; and they have at least as much logic as satisfies
themselves. Job's friends are religious men; they do
not consciously build on lies. One and all they are
convinced that God is invariable in His treatment of
men, never afflicting the innocent, always dealing out
judgment in the precise measure of a man's sin. That
belief is the basis of their creed. They could not
worship a God less than absolutely just. Beginning
the religious life with this faith they have clung to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
all along. After thirty or forty years' experience they
are still confident that their principle explains the
prosperity and affliction, the circumstances of all
human beings. But have they never seen anything
that did not harmonise with this view of providence?
Have they not seen the good die in youth, and those
whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to their
sockets? Have they not seen vile schemes prosper,
and the schemers enjoy their ill-gotten power for years?
It is strange the old faith has not been shaken at least.
But no! They come to the case of Job as firmly convinced
as ever that the Ruler of the world shows His
justice by dispensing joy and suffering in proportion to
men's good and evil deeds, that whenever trouble
falls on any one some sin must have been committed
which deserved precisely this kind and quantity of
suffering.</p>

<p>Trying to get at the source of the belief we must
confess ourselves partly at a loss. One writer suggests
that there may have been in the earlier and simpler
conditions of society a closer correspondence between
wrong-doing and suffering than is to be seen nowadays.
There may be something in this. But life is
not governed differently at different epochs, and the
theory is hardly proved by what we know of the ancient
world. No doubt in the history of the Hebrews, which
lies behind the faith attributed to the friends of Job, a
connection may be traced between their wrong-doing
<i>as a nation</i> and their suffering <i>as a nation</i>. When they
fell away from faith in God their obedience languished,
their vigour failed, the end of their existence being lost
sight of, and so they became the prey of enemies. But
this did not apply to individuals. The good suffered
along with the careless and wicked in seasons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
national calamity. And the history of the people of
Israel would support such a view of the Divine government
so long only as national transgression and its
punishment were alone taken into account. Now,
however, the distinction between the nation and the
individual has clearly emerged. The sin of a community
can no longer explain satisfactorily the sufferings
of a member of the community, faithful among the
unbelieving.</p>

<p>But the theory seems to have been made out rather
by the following course of argument. Always in the
administration of law and the exercise of paternal
authority, transgression has been visited with pain and
deprivation of privilege. The father whose son has
disobeyed him inflicts pain, and, if he is a judicious
father, makes the pain proportionate to the offence.
The ruler, through his judges and officers, punishes
transgression according to some orderly code. Malefactors
are deprived of liberty; they are fined or
scourged, or, in the last resort, executed. Now, having
in this way built up a system of law which inflicts
punishment with more or less justice in proportion to
the offence imputed, men take for granted that what they
do imperfectly is done perfectly by God. They take
for granted that the calamities and troubles He appoints
are ordained according to the same principle, with
precisely the same design, as penalty is inflicted by a
father, a chief, or a king. The reasoning is contradicted
in many ways, but they disregard the difficulties. If
this is not the truth, what other explanation is to be
found? The desire for happiness is keen; pain seems
the worst of evils: and they fail to see that endurance
can be the means of good. Feeling themselves bound
to maintain the perfect righteousness of God they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
affirm the only theory of suffering that seems to agree
with it.</p>

<p>Now, Zophar, like the others full of this theory,
admits that Job may have failed to see his transgression.
But in that case the sufferer is unable to distinguish
right from wrong. Indeed, his whole contention seems
to Zophar to show ignorance. If God were to speak
and reveal the secrets of His holy wisdom, twice as
deep, twice as penetrating as Job supposes, the sins
he has denied would be brought home to him. He
would know that God requires less of him than his
iniquity deserves. Zophar hints, what is very true,
that our judgment of our own conduct is imperfect.
How can we trace the real nature of our actions, or
know how they look to the sublime wisdom of the
Most High? Job appears to have forgotten all this.
He refuses to allow fault in himself. But God knows
better.</p>

<p>Here is a cunning argument to fortify the general
position. It could always be said of a case which
presented difficulties that, while the sufferer seemed
innocent, yet the wisdom of God, "twofold in understanding"
(ver. 6) as compared with that of man,
perceived guilt and ordained the punishment. But
the argument proved too much, for Zophar's own health
and comfort contradicted his dogma. He took for
granted that the twofold wisdom of the Almighty
found nothing wrong in him. It was a naïve piece
of forgetfulness. Could he assert that his life had
no flaw? Hardly. But then, why is he in honour?
How had he been able to come riding on his camel,
attended by his servants, to sit in judgment on Job?
Plainly, on an argument like his, no man could ever
be in comfort or pleasure, for human nature is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
defective, always in more or less of sin. Repentance
never overtakes the future. Therefore God who deals
with man on a broad basis could never treat him save
as a sinner, to be kept in pain and deprivation. If
suffering is the penalty of sin we ought all, notwithstanding
the atonement of Christ, to be suffering the
pain of the hour for the defect of the hour, since "all
have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God." At
this rate man's life&mdash;again despite the atonement&mdash;would
be continued trial and sentence. From all which
it is evident that the world is governed on another plan
than that which satisfied Job's friends.</p>

<p>Zophar rises to eloquence in declaring the unsearchableness
of Divine wisdom.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Canst thou find the depths of Eloah?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Canst thou reach to the end of Shaddai?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Heights of heaven! What canst thou do?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Deeper than Sheol! What canst thou know?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The measure thereof is longer than the earth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Broader is it than the sea.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is fine poetry; but with an attempt at theology
the speaker goes astray, for he conceives God as doing
what he himself wishes to do, namely, prove Job a
sinner. The Divine greatness is invoked that a narrow
scheme of thought may be justified. If God pass by,
if He arrest, if He hold assize, who can hinder Him?
Supreme wisdom and infinite power admit no questioning,
no resistance. God knoweth vain or wicked men
at a glance. One look and all is plain to Him. Empty
man will be wise in these matters "when a wild ass's
colt is born a man."</p>

<p>Turning from this, as if in recollection that he has
to treat Job with friendliness, Zophar closes like the
other two with a promise. If Job will put away sin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
his life shall be established again, his misery forgotten
or remembered as a torrent of spring when the heat
of summer comes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thou shalt forget thy misery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Remember it as waters that have passed by;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thy life shall rise brighter than noonday;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And if darkness fall, it shall be as the morning.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou shalt then have confidence because there is hope;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yea, look around and take rest in safety,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Also lie down and none shall affray thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And many shall make suit unto thee.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But the eyes of the wicked fail;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For them no way of escape.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And their hope is to breathe out the spirit.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Rhetoric and logic are used in promises given freely
by all the speakers. But not one of them has any
comfort for his friend while the affliction lasts. The
author does not allow one of them to say, God is thy
friend, God is thy portion&mdash;now; He still cares for
thee. In some of the psalms a higher note is heard:
"There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon
us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than
in the time that their corn and their wine increased."
The friends of Job are full of pious intentions, yet
they state a most unspiritual creed, the foundation of it
laid in corn and wine. Peace of conscience and quiet
confidence in God are not what they go by. Hence the
sufferer finds no support in them or their promises.
They will not help him to live one day, nor sustain him
in dying. For it is the light of God's countenance
he desires to see. He is only mocked and exasperated
by their arguments; and in the course of his own
eager thought the revelation comes like a star of hope
rising on the midnight of his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Zophar fails like the other two, he is not to
be called a mere echo. It is incorrect to say that,
while Eliphaz is a kind of prophet and Bildad a sage,
Zophar is a commonplace man without ideas. On the
contrary, he is a thinker, something of a philosopher,
although, of course, greatly restricted by his narrow
creed. He is stringent, bitter indeed. But he has
the merit of seeing a certain force in Job's contention
which he does not fairly meet. It is a fresh suggestion
that the answer must lie in the depth of that penetrating
wisdom of the Most High, compared to which
man's wisdom is vain. Then, his description of the
return of blessedness and prosperity, when one examines
it, is found distinctly in advance of Eliphaz's picture
in moral colouring and gravity of treatment. We
must not fail to notice, moreover, that Zophar speaks
of the omniscience of God more than of His omnipotence;
and the closing verse describes the end of the
wicked not as the result of a supernatural stroke or
a sudden calamity, but as a process of natural and
spiritual decay.</p>

<p>The closing words of Zophar's speech point to the
finality of death, and bear the meaning that if Job were
to die now of his disease the whole question of his
character would be closed. It is important to note
this, because it enters into Job's mind and affects his
expressions of desire. Never again does he cry for
release as before. If he names death it is as a sorrowful
fate he must meet or a power he will defy. He
advances to one point after another of reasserted
energy, to the resolution that, whatever death may do,
either in the underworld or beyond it he will wait for
vindication or assert his right.</p>

<p class="center"><i>BEYOND FACT AND FEAR TO GOD.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chaps.</span> xii.-xiv.</p>


<p>Zophar excites in Job's mind great irritation,
which must not be set down altogether to the
fact that he is the third to speak. In some respects he
has made the best attack from the old position, pressing
most upon the conscience of Job. He has also
used a curt positive tone in setting out the method and
principle of Divine government and the judgment he
has formed of his friend's state. Job is accordingly
the more impatient, if not disconcerted. Zophar had
spoken of the want of understanding Job had shown,
and the penetrating wisdom of God which at a glance
convicts men of iniquity. His tone provoked resentment.
Who is this that claims to have solved the
enigmas of providence, to have gone into the depths of
wisdom? Does he know any more, he himself, than
the wild ass's colt?</p>

<p>And Job begins with stringent irony&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>No doubt but ye are the people,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And wisdom shall die with you.</i>"<br /></span>

<p>The secrets of thought, of revelation itself are yours.
No doubt the world waited to be taught till you were
born. Do you not think so? But, after all, I also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
have a share of understanding, I am not quite so void
of intellect as you seem to fancy. Besides, who
knoweth not such things as ye speak? Are they
new? I had supposed them to be commonplaces.
Yea, if you recall what I said, you will find that with
a little more vigour than yours I made the same
declarations.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>A laughing-stock to his neighbours am I,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I who called upon Eloah and He answered me,&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>A laughing-stock, the righteous and perfect man.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Job sees or thinks he sees that his misery makes
him an object of contempt to men who once gave him
the credit of far greater wisdom and goodness than
their own. They are bringing out old notions, which
are utterly useless, to explain the ways of God; they
assume the place of teachers; they are far better, far
wiser now than he. It is more than flesh can bear.</p>

<p>As he looks at his own diseased body and feels again
his weakness, the cruelty of the conventional judgment
stings him. "In the thought of him that is at ease
there is for misfortune scorn; it awaiteth them that
slip with the foot." Perhaps Job was mistaken, but it
is too often true that the man who fails in a social
sense is the man suspected. Evil things are found in
him when he is covered with the dust of misfortune,
things which no one dreamed of before. Flatterers
become critics and judges. They find that he has a
bad heart or that he is a fool.</p>

<p>But if those very good and wise friends of Job are
astonished at anything previously said, they shall be
more astonished. The facts which their account of
Divine providence very carefully avoided as inconvenient
Job will blurt out. They have stated and
restated, with utmost complacency, their threadbare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
theory of the government of God. Let them look now
abroad on the world and see what actually goes on,
blinking no facts.</p>

<p>The tents of robbers prosper. Out in the desert
there are troops of bandits who are never overtaken by
justice; and they that provoke God are secure, who
carry a god in their hand, whose sword and the reckless
daring with which they use it make them to all
appearance safe in villainy. These are the things
to be accounted for; and, accounting for them, Job
launches into a most emphatic argument to prove all
that is done in the world strangely and inexplicably
to be the doing of God. As to that he will allow no
question. His friends shall know that he is sound on
this head. And let them provide the defence of Divine
righteousness after he has spoken.</p>

<p>Here, however, it is necessary to consider in what
way the limitations of Hebrew thought must have been
felt by one who, turning from the popular creed,
sought a view more in harmony with fact. Now-a-days
the word <i>nature</i> is often made to stand for a
force or combination of forces conceived of as either
entirely or partially independent of God. Tennyson
makes the distinction when he speaks of man</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who trusted God was love indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And love creation's final law,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Though nature, red in tooth and claw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With ravin, shrieked against the creed"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and again when he asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Are God and nature then at strife<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That nature lends such evil dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So careful of the type she seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So careless of the single life?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now to this question, perplexing enough on the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of it when we consider what suffering there is in the
creation, how the waves of life seem to beat and break
themselves age after age on the rocks of death, the
answer in its first stage is that God and nature cannot
be at strife. They are not apart; there is but one
universe, therefore one Cause. One Omnipotent there
is whose will is done, whose character is shown in all
we see and all we cannot see, the issues of endless
strife, the long results of perennial evolution. But then
comes the question, What is His character, of what
spirit is He who alone rules, who sends after the calm
the fierce storm, after the beauty of life the corruption
of death? And one may say the struggle between
Bible religion and modern science is on this very field.</p>

<p>Cold heartless power, say some; no Father, but an
impersonal Will to which men are nothing, human joy
and love nothing, to which the fair blossom is no more
than the clod, and the holy prayer no better than the
vile sneer. On this, faith arises to the struggle.
Faith warm and hopeful takes reason into counsel,
searches the springs of existence, goes forth into the
future and forecasts the end, that it may affirm and
reaffirm against all denial that One Omnipotent
reigns who is all-loving, the Father of infinite mercy.
Here is the arena; here the conflict rages and will
rage for many a day. And to him will belong the
laurels of the age who, with the Bible in one hand and
the instruments of science in the other, effects the
reconciliation of faith with fact. Tennyson came with
the questions of our day. He passes and has not
given a satisfactory answer. Carlyle has gone with
the "Everlasting Yea and No" beating through his
oracles. Even Browning, a later athlete, did not find
complete reason for faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From Thy will stream the worlds, life, and nature, Thy dread sabaoth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now return to Job. He considers nature; he believes
in God; he stands firmly on the conviction that all is
of God. Hebrew faith held this, and was not limited
in holding it, for it is the fact. But we cannot wonder
that providence disconcerted him, since the reconciliation
of "merciless" nature and the merciful God is not
even yet wrought out. Notwithstanding the revelation
of Christ, many still find themselves in darkness just
when light is most urgently craved. Willing to believe,
they yet lean to a dualism which makes God Himself
appear in conflict with the scheme of things, thwarted
now and now repentant, gracious in design but not
always in effect. Now the limitation of the Hebrew
was this, that to his idea the infinite power of God was
not balanced by infinite mercy, that is, by regard to the
whole work of His hands. In one stormy dash after
another Job is made to attempt this barrier. At
moments he is lifted beyond it, and sees the great
universe filled with Divine care that equals power;
for the present, however, he distinguishes between
merciful intent and merciless, and ascribes both to
God.</p>

<p>What does he say? God is in the deceived and in
the deceiver; they are both products of nature, that
is, creatures of God. He increaseth the nations and
destroyeth them. Cities arise and become populous.
The great metropolis is filled with its myriads, "among
whom are six-score thousand that cannot discern between
their right hand and their left." The city shall
fulfil its cycle and perish. It is God. Searching for
reconciliation Job looks the facts of human existence
right in the face, and he sees a confusion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
whole enigma which lies in the constitution of the
world and of the soul. Observe how his thought
moves. The beasts, the fowls of the air, the fishes of
the sea, all living beings everywhere, not self-created,
with no power to shape or resist their destiny, bear
witness to the almightiness of God. In His hand is
the lower creation; in His hand also, rising higher, is
the breath of all mankind. Absolute, universal is that
power, dispensing life and death as it broods over the
ages. Men have sought to understand the ways of the
Great Being. The ear trieth words as the mouth
tasteth meat. Is there wisdom with the ancient, those
who live long, as Bildad says? Yes: but with God
are wisdom <i>and strength</i>; not penetration only, but
power. He discerns and does. He demolishes, and
there is no rebuilding. Man is imprisoned, shut up by
misfortune, by disease. It is God's decree, and there
is no opening till He allows. At His will the waters
are dried up; at His will they pour in torrents over the
earth. And so amongst men there are currents of evil
and good flowing through lives, here in the liar and
cheat, there in the victim of knavery; here in the
counsellors whose plans come to nothing, there in the
judges whose sagacity is changed to folly; and all these
currents and cross-currents, making life a bewildering
maze, have their beginning in the will of God, who
seems to take pleasure in doing what is strange and
baffling. Kings take men captive; the bonds of the
captives are loosed, and the kings themselves are
bound. What are princes and priests, what are the
mighty to Him? What is the speech of the eloquent?
Where is the understanding of the aged when He
spreads confusion? Deep as in the very gloom of the
grave the ambitious may hide their schemes; the flux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of events brings them out to judgment, one cannot
foresee how. Nations are raised up and destroyed;
the chiefs of the people are made to fear like children.
Trusted leaders wander in a wilderness; they grope
in midnight gloom; they stagger like the drunken.
Behold, says Job, all this I have seen. This is God's
doing. And with this great God he would speak; he,
a man, would have things out with the Lord of all
(chap. xiii. 3).</p>

<p>This impetuous passage, full of revolution, disaster,
vast mutations, a phantasmagoria of human struggle
and defeat, while it supplies a note of time and gives
a distinct clue to the writer's position as an Israelite,
is remarkable for the faith that survives its apparent
pessimism. Others have surveyed the world and the
history of change, and have protested with their last
voice against the cruelty that seemed to rule. As for
any God, they could never trust one whose will and
power were to be found alike in the craft of the deceiver
and the misery of the victim, in the baffling of sincere
thought and the overthrow of the honest with the vile.
But Job trusts on. Beneath every enigma, he looks for
reason; beyond every disaster, to a Divine end. The
voices of men have come between him and the voice of
the Supreme. Personal disaster has come between
him and his sense of God. His thought is not free.
If it were, he would catch the reconciling word, his
soul would hear the music of eternity. "I would
reason with God." He clings to God-given reason as
his instrument of discovery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very bold is this whole position, and very reverent
also, if you will think of it; far more honouring to God
than any attempt of the friends who, as Job says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
appear to hold the Almighty no better than a petty chief,
so insecure in His position that He must be grateful
to any one who will justify His deeds. "Poor God,
with nobody to help Him." Job uses all his irony
in exposing the folly of such a religion, the impertinence
of presenting it to him as a solution and a
help. In short, he tells them, they are pious quacks,
and, as he will have none of them for his part, he
thinks God will not either. The author is at the very
heart of religion here. The word of reproof and correction,
the plea for providence must go straight to
the reason of man, or it is of no use. The word of
the Lord must be a two-edged sword of truth, piercing
to the dividing asunder even of soul and spirit. That
is to say, into the centre of energy the truth must be
driven which kills the spirit of rebellion, so that the
will of man, set free, may come into conscious and
passionate accord with the will of God. But reconciliation
is impossible unless each will deal in the utmost
sincerity with truth, realising the facts of existence,
the nature of the soul and the great necessities of its
discipline. To be true in theology we must not accept
what seems to be true, nor speak forensically, but
affirm what we have proved in our own life and gathered
in utmost effort from Scripture and from nature. Men
inherit opinions as they used to inherit garments, or
devise them, like clothes of a new fashion, and from
within the folds they speak, not as men but as priests,
what is the right thing according to a received theory.
It will not do. Even of old time a man like the author
of Job turned contemptuously from school-made explanations
and sought a living word. In our age the
number of those whose fever can be lulled with a
working theory of religion and a judicious arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
of the universe is rapidly becoming small. Theology
is being driven to look the facts of life full in the face.
If the world has learned anything from modern science,
it is the habit of rigorous research and the justification
of free inquiry, and the lesson will never be unlearned.</p>

<p>To take one error of theology. All men are concluded
equally under God's wrath and curse; then the
proofs of the malediction are found in trouble, fear and
pain. But what comes of this teaching? Out in the
world, with facts forcing themselves on consciousness,
the scheme is found hollow. All are not in trouble and
pain. Those who are afflicted and disappointed are
often sincere Christians. A theory of deferred judgment
and happiness is made for escape; it does not,
however, in the least enable one to comprehend how,
if pain and trouble be the consequences of sin, they
should not be distributed rightly from the first. A
universal moral order cannot begin in a manner so
doubtful, so very difficult for the wayfaring man to
read as he goes. To hold that it can is to turn religion
into an occultism which at every point bewilders the
simple mind. The theory is one which tends to blunt
the sense of sin in those who are prosperous, and to
beget that confident Pharisaism which is the curse of
church-life. On the other hand, the "sacrificed classes,"
contrasting their own moral character with that of the
frivolous and fleshly rich, are forced to throw over a
theology which binds together sin and suffering, and to
deny a God whose equity is so far to seek. And yet,
again, in the recoil from all this men invent wersh
schemes of bland good-will and comfort, which have
simply nothing to do with the facts of life, no basis in
the world as we know it, no sense of the rigour of
Divine love. So Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with us and confuse theology until some think it lost
in unreason.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Job sets them down with a current proverb&mdash;"Even
a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise."
He begs them to be silent. They shall now hear his
rebuke.</p>

<span class="i1"><i>Or for God will ye contend?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Job finds them guilty of speaking falsely as special
pleaders for God in two respects. They insist that he
has offended God, but they cannot point to one sin which
he has committed. On the other hand, they affirm
positively that God will restore prosperity if confession
is made. But in this too they play the part of advocates
without warrant. They show great presumption in
daring to pledge the Almighty to a course in accordance
with their idea of justice. The issue might be what
they predict; it might not. They are venturing on
ground to which their knowledge does not extend.
They think their presumption justified because it is
for religion's sake. Job administers a sound rebuke,
and it extends to our own time. Special pleaders for
God's sovereign and unconditional right and for His
illimitable good-nature, alike have warning here. What
justification have men in affirming that God will work
out His problems in detail according to their views?
He has given to us the power to apprehend the great
principles of His working. He has revealed much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
nature, providence, and Scripture, and in Christ; but
there is the "hiding of His power," "His path is in the
mighty waters, and His judgments are not known."
Christ has said, "It is not for you to know times and
seasons which the Father hath set within His own
authority." There are certainties of our consciousness,
facts of the world and of revelation from which we can
argue. Where these confirm, we may dogmatise, and
the dogma will strike home. But no piety, no desire
to vindicate the Almighty or to convict and convert
the sinner, can justify any man in passing beyond the
certainty which God has given him to that unknown
which lies far above human ken.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He will surely correct you</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If in secret ye are partial.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Shall not His majesty terrify you,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And His dread fall upon you?</i>" (<i>chap. xiii.</i> 10, 11).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Book of Job, while it brands insincerity and
loose reasoning, justifies all honest and reverent
research. Here, as in the teaching of our Lord, the
real heretic is he who is false to his own reason and
conscience, to the truth of things as God gives him
to apprehend it, who, in short, makes believe to any
extent in the sphere of religion. And it is upon this
man the terror of the Divine majesty is to fall.</p>

<p>We saw how Bildad established himself on the
wisdom of the ancients. Recalling this, Job flings
contempt on his traditional sayings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Your remembrances are proverbs of ashes,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Your defences, defences of dust.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Did they mean to smite him with those proverbs as
with stones? They were ashes. Did they intrench
themselves from the assaults of reason behind old suppositions?
Their ramparts were mere dust. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
more he bids them hold their peace, and let him alone
that he may speak out all that is in his mind. It is, he
knows, at the hazard of his life he goes forward; but
he will. The case in which he is can have no remedy
excepting by an appeal to God, and that final appeal
he will make.</p>

<p>Now the proper beginning of this appeal is in the
twenty-third verse, with the words: "How many are
mine iniquities and my sins?" But before Job reaches
it he expresses his sense of the danger and difficulty
under which he lies, interweaving with the statement
of these a marvellous confidence in the result of what
he is about to do. Referring to the declarations of his
friends as to the danger that yet threatens if he will
not confess sin, he uses a proverbial expression for
hazard of life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Why do I take my flesh in my teeth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And put my life in my hand?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why do I incur this danger, do you say? Never
mind. It is not your affair. For bare existence I
care nothing. To escape with mere consciousness for
a while is no object to me, as I now am. With my
life in my hand I hasten to God.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Lo! He will slay me: I will not delay&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet my ways will I maintain before Him</i>" (<i>chap. xiii.</i> 15).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The old Version here, "Though He slay me, yet will
I trust in Him," is inaccurate. Still it is not far from
expressing the brave purpose of the man&mdash;prostrate
before God, yet resolved to cling to the justice of the
case as he apprehends it, assured that this will not
only be excused by God, but will bring about his
acquittal or salvation. To grovel in the dust, confessing
himself a miserable sinner more than worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
all the sufferings he has undergone, while in his heart
he has the consciousness of being upright and faithful&mdash;this
would not commend him to the Judge of all the
earth. It would be a mockery of truth and righteousness,
therefore of God Himself. On the other hand,
to maintain his integrity which God gave him, to go
on maintaining it at the hazard of all, is his only course,
his only safety.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>This also shall be my salvation,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For a godless man shall not live before Him.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fine moral instinct of Job, giving courage to his
theology, declares that God demands "truth in the
inward parts" and truth in speech&mdash;that man "consists
in truth"&mdash;that "if he betrays truth he betrays
himself," which is a crime against his Maker. No man
is so much in danger of separating himself from God
and losing everything as he who acts or speaks
against conviction.</p>

<p>Job has declared his hazard, that he is lying
helpless before Almighty Power which may in a
moment crush him. He has also expressed his faith,
that approaching God in the courage of truth he will
not be rejected, that absolute sincerity will alone give
him a claim on the Infinitely True. Now turning to
his friends as if in new defiance, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Hear diligently my speech,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And my explanation with your ears.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold now, I have ordered my cause;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I know that I shall be justified.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who is he that will contend with me?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For then would I hold my peace and expire.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is to say, he has reviewed his life once more, he
has considered all possibilities of transgression, and
yet his contention remains. So much does he build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
upon his claim on God that, if any one could now
convict him, his heart would fail, life would no more
be worth living; the foundation of hope destroyed,
conflict would be at an end.</p>

<p>But with his plea to God still in view he expresses
once more his sense of the disadvantage under which
he lies. The pressure of the Divine hand is upon him
still, a sore enervating terror which bears upon his
soul. Would God but give him respite for a little from
the pain and the fear, then he would be ready either to
answer the summons of the Judge or make his own
demand for vindication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may suppose an interval of release from pain or
at least a pause of expectancy, and then, in verse
twenty-third, Job begins his cry. The language is
less vehement than we have heard. It has more of
the pathos of weak human life. He is one with that
race of thinking, feeling, suffering creatures who are
tossed about on the waves of existence, driven before
the winds of change like autumn leaves. It is the plea
of human feebleness and mortality we hear, and then,
as the "still sad music" touches the lowest note of
wailing, there mingles with it the strain of hope.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>How many are mine iniquities and sins?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are not to understand here that Job confesses
great transgressions, nor, contrariwise, that he denies
infirmity and error in himself. There are no doubt
failures of his youth which remain in memory, sins of
desire, errors of ignorance, mistakes in conduct such as
the best men fall into. These he does not deny. But
righteousness and happiness have been represented as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
a profit and loss account, and therefore Job wishes to
hear from God a statement in exact form of all he has
done amiss or failed to do, so that he may be able to
see the relation between fault and suffering, his faults
and his sufferings, if such relation there be. It appears
that God is counting him an enemy (ver. 24). He
would like to have the reason for that. So far as he
knows himself he has sought to obey and honour the
Almighty. Certainly there has never been in his heart
any conscious desire to resist the will of Eloah. Is it
then for transgressions unwittingly committed that he
now suffers&mdash;for sins he did not intend or know of?
God is just. It is surely a part of His justice to make
a sufferer aware why such terrible afflictions befal
him.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;is it worth while for the Almighty to be
so hard on a poor weak mortal?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Wilt thou scare a driven leaf&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Wilt thou pursue the dry stubble&mdash;</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>And makest me to possess the faults of my youth,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>As a garment that is moth-eaten?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sense of rigid restraint and pitiable decay was
perhaps never expressed with so fit and vivid imagery.
So far it is personal. Then begins a general lamentation
regarding the sad fleeting life of man. His own
prosperity, which passed as a dream, has become to Job
a type of the brief vain existence of the race tried at
every moment by inexorable Divine judgment; and the
low mournful words of the Arabian chief have echoed
ever since in the language of sorrow and loss.</p>

<p>Human frailty is both of the body and of the soul;
and it is universal. The nativity of men forbids their
purity. Well does God know the weakness of His
creatures; and why then does He expect of them, if
indeed He expects, a pureness that can stand the test
of His searching? Job cannot be free from the common
infirmity of mortals. He is born of woman. But why
then is he chased with inquiry, haunted and scared

pressing down his thought.</p>

<p>No arguments, no promises can break this deep gloom
and silence into which the life of man passes. Once
Job had sought death; now a desire has grown within
him, and with it recoil from Sheol. To meet God,
to obtain his own justification and the clearing of
Divine righteousness, to have the problem of life explained&mdash;the
hope of this makes life precious. Is he
to lie down and rise no more while the skies endure?
Is no voice to reach him from the heavenly justice he
has always confided in? The very thought is confounding.
If he were now to desire death it would
mean that he had given up all faith, that justice, truth,
and even the Divine name of Eloah had ceased to have
any value for him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are to behold the rise of a new hope, like a star
in the firmament of his thought. Whence does it
spring?</p>

<p>The religion of the Book of Job, as already shown,
is, in respect of form, a natural religion; that is to say,
the ideas are not derived from the Hebrew Scriptures.
The writer does not refer to the legislation of Moses
and the great words of prophets. The expression "As
the Lord said unto Moses" does not occur in this book,
nor any equivalent. It is through nature and the
human consciousness that the religious beliefs of the
poem appear to have come into shape. Yet two facts
are to be kept fully in view.</p>

<p>The first is that even a natural religion must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
supposed to be a thing of man's invention, with no
origin further than his dreams. We must not declare
all religious ideas outside those of Israel to be mere
fictions of the human fancy or happy guesses at truth.
The religion of Teman may have owed some of its great
thoughts to Israel. But, apart from that, a basis of
Divine revelation is always laid wherever men think
and live. In every land the heart of man has borne
witness to God. Reverent thought, dwelling on justice,
truth, mercy, and all virtues found in the range of
experience and consciousness, came through them to
the idea of God. Every one who made an induction as
to the Great Unseen Being, his mind open to the facts
of nature and his own moral constitution, was in a
sense a prophet. As far as they went, the reality and
value of religious ideas, so reached, are acknowledged
by Bible writers themselves. "The invisible things of
God from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
being perceived through the things that are made, even
His everlasting power and divinity." God has always
been revealing Himself to men.</p>

<p>"Natural religion" we say: and yet, since God is
always revealing Himself and has made all men more
or less capable of apprehending the revelation, even
the natural is supernatural. Take the religion of
Egypt, or of Chaldæa, or of Persia. You may contrast
any one of these with the religion of Israel; you may
call the one natural, the other revealed. But the
Persian speaking of the Great Good Spirit or the
Chaldæan worshipping a supreme Lord must have had
some kind of revelation; and his sense of it, not clear
indeed, far enough below that of Moses or Isaiah, was
yet a forth-reaching towards the same light as now
shines for us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Next we must keep it in view that Job does not
appear as a thinker building on himself alone, depending
on his own religious experience. Centuries and
ages of thought are behind these beliefs which are
ascribed to him, even the ideas which seem to start
up freshly as the result of original discovery. Imagine
a man thinking for himself about Divine things in that
far-away Arabian past. His mind, to begin with, is
not a blank. His father has instructed him. There
is a faith that has come down from many generations.
He has found words in use which hold in them religious
ideas, discoveries, perceptions of Divine reality, caught
and fixed ages before. When he learned language the
products of evolution, not only psychical, but intellectual
and spiritual, became his. Eloah, the lofty one, the
righteousness of Eloah, the word of Eloah, Eloah as
Creator, as Watcher of men, Eloah as wise, unsearchable
in wisdom, as strong, infinitely mighty,&mdash;these are
ideas he has not struck out for himself, but inherited.
Clearly then a new thought, springing from these,
comes as a supernatural communication and has behind
it ages of spiritual evolution. It is new, but has its
root in the old; it is natural, but originates in the
over-nature.</p>

<p>Now the primitive religion of the Semites, the race
to which Job belonged, to which also the Hebrews
belonged, has been of late carefully studied; and with
regard to it certain things have been established that
bear on the new hope we are to find struck out by the
Man of Uz.</p>

<p>In the early morning of religious thought among those
Semites it was universally believed that the members
of a family or tribe, united by blood-relationship to
each other, were also related in the same way to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
God. He was their father, the invisible head and
source of their community, on whom they had a claim
so long as they pleased him. His interest in them was
secured by the sacrificial meal which he was invited
and believed to share with them. If he had been
offended, the sacrificial offering was the means of
recovering his favour; and communion with him in
those meals and sacrifices was the inheritance of all
who claimed the kinship of that clan or tribe. With
the clearing of spiritual vision this belief took a new
form in the minds of the more thoughtful. The idea of
communion remained and the necessity of it to the life
of the worshipper was felt even more strongly when
the kinship of the God with his subject family was, for
the few at least, no longer an affair of physical descent
and blood-relationship, but of spiritual origin and
attachment. And when faith rose from the tribal god
to the idea of the Heaven-Father, the one Creator
and King, communion with Him was felt to be in the
highest sense a vital necessity. Here is found the
religion of Job. A main element of it was communion
with Eloah, an ethical kinship with Him, no arbitrary
or merely physical relation, but of the spirit. That is
to say, Job has at the heart of his creed the truth as
to man's origin and nature. The author of the book
is a Hebrew; his own faith is that of the people from
whom we have the Book of Genesis; but he treats here
of man's relation to God from the ethnic side, such as
may be taken now by a reasoner treating of spiritual
evolution.</p>

<p>Communion with Eloah had been Job's life, and with
it had been associated his many years of wealth,
dignity, and influence. Lest his children should fall
from it and lose their most precious inheritance, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
used to bring the periodical offerings. But at length
his own communion was interrupted. The sense of
being at one with Eloah, if not lost, became dull and
faint. It is for the restoration of his very life&mdash;not
as we might think of religious feeling, but of actual
spirit energy&mdash;he is now concerned. It is this that
underlies his desire for God to speak with him, his
demand for an opportunity of pleading his cause.
Some might expect that he would ask his friends to
offer sacrifice on his behalf. But he makes no such
request. The crisis has come in a region higher than
sacrifice, where observances are of no use. Thought
only can reach it; the discovery of reconciling truth
alone can satisfy. Sacrifices which for the old world
sustained the relation with God could no more for Job
restore the intimacy of the spiritual Lord. With a
passion for this fellowship keener than ever, since he
now more distinctly realises what it is, a fear blends
in the heart of the man. Death will be upon him soon.
Severed from God he will fall away into the privation
of that world where is neither praise nor service, knowledge
nor device. Yet the truth which lies at the
heart of his religion does not yield. Leaning all upon
it, he finds it strong, elastic. He sees at least a possibility
of reconciliation; for how can the way back to
God ever be quite closed?</p>

<p>What difficulty there was in his effort we know.
To the common thought of the time when this book
was written, say that of Hezekiah, the state of the dead
was not extinction indeed, but an existence of extreme
tenuity and feebleness. In Sheol there was nothing
active. The hollow ghost of the man was conceived
of as neither hoping nor fearing, neither originating
nor receiving impressions. Yet Job dares to anticipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
that even in Sheol a set time of remembrance will
be ordained for him and he shall hear the thrilling
call of God. As it approaches this climax the poem
flashes and glows with prophetic fire.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Oh that Thou would'st hide me in Sheol,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That Thou would'st keep me secret until Thy wrath be past,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That Thou would'st appoint a set time, and remember me!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If a (strong) man die, shall he live?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>All the days of my appointed time would I wait</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Till my release came.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou would'st call, I would answer Thee;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou would'st have a desire to the work of Thy hands.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not easily can we now realise the extraordinary step
forward made in thought when the anticipation was
thrown out of spiritual life going on beyond death
("would I wait"), retaining intellectual potency in
that region otherwise dark and void to the human
imagination ("I would answer Thee"). From both the
human side and the Divine the poet has advanced a
magnificent intuition, a springing arch into which he is
unable to fit the keystone&mdash;the spiritual body; for He
only could do this who long afterwards came to be
Himself the Resurrection and the Life. But when
this poem of Job had been given to the world a new
thought was implanted in the soul of the race, a new
hope that should fight against the darkness of Sheol
till that morning when the sunrise fell upon an empty
sepulchre, and one standing in the light asked of
sorrowful men, Why seek ye the living among the
dead?</p>

<p>"Thou would'st have a desire to the work of Thy
hands." What a philosophy of Divine care underlies
the words! They come with a force Job seems hardly
to realise. Is there a High One who makes men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
His own image, capable of fine achievement, and then
casts them away in discontent or loathing? The voice
of the poet rings in a passionate key because he rises to
a thought practically new to the human mind. He has
broken through barriers both of faith and doubt into
the light of his hope and stands trembling on the verge
of another world. "One must have had a keen perception
of the profound relation between the creature
and his Maker in the past to be able to give utterance
to such an imaginative expectation respecting the
future."</p>

<p>But the wrath of God still appears to rest upon Job's
life; still He seems to keep in reserve, sealed up,
unrevealed, some record of transgressions for which
He has condemned His servant. From the height of
hope Job falls away into an abject sense of the decay
and misery to which man is brought by the continued
rigour of Eloah's examination. As with shocks of
earthquake mountains are broken, and waters by
constant flowing wash down the soil and the plants
rooted in it, so human life is wasted by the Divine
severity. In the world the children whom a man loved
are exalted or brought low, but he knows nothing of
it. His flesh corrupts in the grave and his soul in
Sheol languishes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thou destroyest the hope of man.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou ever prevailest against him, and he passeth;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou changest his countenance and sendest him away.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The real is at this point so grim and insistent as to
shut off the ideal and confine thought again to its own
range. The energy of the prophetic mind is overborne,
and unintelligible fact surrounds and presses
hard the struggling personality.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE TRADITION OF A PURE RACE.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Eliphaz speaks. Chap.</span> xv.</p>


<p>The first colloquy has made clear severance
between the old Theology and the facts of human
life. No positive reconciliation is effected as yet
between reality and faith, no new reading of Divine
providence has been offered. The author allows the
friends on the one hand, Job on the other, to seek the
end of controversy just as men in their circumstances
would in real life have sought it. Unable to penetrate
behind the veil the one side clings obstinately to the
ancestral faith, on the other side the persecuted
sufferer strains after a hope of vindication apart from
any return of health and prosperity, which he dares
not expect. One of the conditions of the problem is
the certainty of death. Before death, repentance and
restoration,&mdash;say the friends. Death immediate, therefore
should God hear me, vindicate me,&mdash;says Job. In
desperation he breaks through to the hope that God's
wrath will pass even though his scared and harrowed
life be driven into Sheol. For a moment he sees the
light; then it seems to expire. To the orthodox
friends any such thought is a kind of blasphemy.
They believe in the nullity of the state beyond death.
There is no wisdom nor hope in the grave. "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
dead know not anything, neither have they any more a
reward; for the memory of them is forgotten"&mdash;even
by God. "As well their love, as their hatred and
their envy, is now perished; neither have they any
more a portion for ever in anything that is done under
the sun" (Eccles. ix. 5, 6). On the mind of Job this
dark shadow falls and hides the star of his hope. To
pass away under the reprobation of men and of God, to
suffer the final stroke and be lost for ever in the deep
darkness;&mdash;anticipating this, how can he do otherwise
than make a desperate fight for his own consciousness
of right and for God's intervention while yet any
breath is left in him? He persists in this. The friends
do not approach him one step in thought; instead of
being moved by his pathetic entreaties they draw back
into more bigoted judgment.</p>

<p>In opening the new circle of debate Eliphaz might
be expected to yield a little, to admit something in the
claim of the sufferer, granting at least for the sake of
argument that his case is hard. But the writer wishes
to show the rigour and determination of the old
creed, or rather of the men who preach it. He will
not allow them one sign of <i>rapprochement</i>. In the
same order as before the three advance their theory,
making no attempt to explain the facts of human
existence to which their attention has been called.
Between the first and the second round there is,
indeed, a change of position, but in the line of greater
hardness. The change is thus marked. Each of the
three, differing <i>toto c&#339;lo</i> from Job's view of his case,
had introduced an encouraging promise. Eliphaz had
spoken of six troubles, yea seven, from which one
should be delivered if he accepted the chastening of
the Lord. Bildad affirmed</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold, God will not cast away the perfect:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thy lips with shouting.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Zophar had said that if Job would put away iniquity
he should be led into fearless calm.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thou shall be steadfast and not fear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For thou shalt forget thy misery;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Remember it as waters that are passed by.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is a note of the first series of arguments; we
hear nothing of it in the second. One after another
drives home a stern, uncompromising judgment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dramatic art of the author has introduced
several touches into the second speech of Eliphaz
which maintain the personality. For example, the
formula "I have seen" is carried on from the former
address where it repeatedly occurs, and is now used
quite incidentally, therefore with all the more effect.
Again the "crafty" are spoken of in both addresses
with contempt and aversion, neither of the other interlocutors
of Job nor Job himself using the word. The
thought of chap. xv. 15 is also the same as that
ventured upon in chap. iv. 18, a return to the oracle
which gave Eliphaz his claim to be a prophet. Meanwhile
he adopts from Bildad the appeal to ancient
belief in support of his position; but he has an original
way of enforcing this appeal. As a pure Temanite he
is animated by the pride of race and claims more for
his progenitors than could be allowed to a Shuchite or
Naamathite, more, certainly, than could be allowed to
one who dwelt among worshippers of the sun and
moon. As a whole the thought of Eliphaz remains
what it was, but more closely brought to a point. He
does not wander now in search of possible explanations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
He fancies that Job has convicted himself and
that little remains but to show most definitely the fate
he seems bent on provoking. It will be a kindness to
impress this on his mind.</p>

<p>The first part of the address, extending to verse 13,
is an expostulation with Job, whom in irony he calls
"wise." Should a wise man use empty unprofitable
talk, filling his bosom, as it were, with the east wind,
peculiarly blustering and arid? Yet what Job says is
not only unprofitable, it is profane.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thou doest away with piety</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And hinderest devotion before God.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For thine iniquity instructs thy mouth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thine own mouth condemneth thee; not I;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thine own lips testify against thee.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eliphaz is thoroughly sincere. Some of the expressions
used by his friend must have seemed to him
to strike at the root of reverence. Which were they?
One was the affirmation that tents of robbers prosper
and they that provoke God are secure; another the
daring statement that the deceived and the deceiver are
both God's; again the confident defence of his own life:
"Behold now I have ordered my cause, I know that I am
righteous; who is he that will contend with me?" and
once more his demand why God harassed him, a driven
leaf, treating him with oppressive cruelty. Things
like these were very offensive to a mind surcharged
with veneration and occupied with a single idea of
Divine government. From the first convinced that
gross fault or arrogant self-will had brought down the
malediction of God, Eliphaz could not but think that
Job's iniquity was "teaching his mouth" (coming
out in his speech, forcing him to profane expressions),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and that he was choosing the tongue of the crafty. It
seemed that he was trying to throw dust in their eyes.
With the cunning and shiftiness of a man who hoped
to carry off his evil-doing, he had talked of maintaining
his ways before God and being vindicated in that
region where, as every one knew, recovery was impossible.
The ground of all certainty and belief was
shaken by those vehement words. Eliphaz felt that
piety was done away and devotion hindered, he could
scarcely breathe a prayer in this atmosphere foul with
scepticism and blasphemy.</p>

<p>The writer means us to enter into the feelings of
this man, to think with him, for the time, sympathetically.
It is no moral fault to be over-jealous for the
Almighty, although it is a misconception of man's
place and duty, as Elijah learned in the wilderness,
when, having claimed to be the only believer left, he
was told there were seven thousand that never bowed
the knee to Baal. The speaker has this justification,
that he does not assume office as advocate for God.
His religion is part of him, his feeling of shock and
disturbance quite natural. Blind to the unfairness of
the situation he does not consider the incivility of
joining with two others to break down one sick
bereaved man, to scare a driven leaf. This is accidental.
Controversy begun, a pious man is bound to carry on,
as long as may be necessary, the argument which is to
save a soul.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, being human, he mingles a tone of
sarcasm as he proceeds.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The first man wast thou born?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or wast thou made before the hills?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Did'st thou hearken in the conclave of God?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And dost thou keep the wisdom to thyself?</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Job had accused his friends of speaking unrighteously
for God and respecting His person. This pricked.
Instead of replying in soft words as he claims to have
been doing hitherto ("Are the consolations of God too
small for thee and a word that dealt tenderly with
thee?"), Eliphaz takes to the sarcastic proverb.
The author reserves dramatic gravity and passion for
Job, as a rule, and marks the others by varying tones
of intellectual hardness, of current raillery. Eliphaz
now is permitted to show more of the self-defender
than the defender of faith. The result is a loss of
dignity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>What knowest thou that we know not?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>What understandest thou that is not in us?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After all it is man's reason against man's reason.
The answer will only come in the judgment of the
Highest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>With us is he who is both grey-haired and very old,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Older in days than thy father.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not Eliphaz himself surely. That would be to
claim too great antiquity. Besides, it seems a little
wanting in sense. More probably there is reference
to some aged rabbi, such as every community loved to
boast of, the Nestor of the clan, full of ancient wisdom.
Eliphaz really believes that to be old is to be near the
fountain of truth. There was an origin of faith and
pure life. The fathers were nearer that holy source;
and wisdom meant going back as far as possible up
the stream. To insist on this was to place a real
barrier in the way of Job's self-defence. He would
scarcely deny it as the theory of religion. What then
of his individual protest, his philosophy of the hour
and of his own wishes? The conflict is presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
here with much subtlety, a standing controversy in
human thought. Fixed principles there must be;
personal research, experience and passion there are,
new with every new age. How settle the antithesis?
The Catholic doctrine has not yet been struck out that
will fuse in one commanding law the immemorial convictions
of the race and the widening visions of the
living soul. The agitation of the church to-day is
caused by the presence within her of Eliphaz and Job&mdash;Eliphaz
standing for the fathers and their faith, Job
passing through a fever-crisis of experience and finding
no remedy in the old interpretations. The church is
apt to say, Here is moral disease, sin; we have nothing
for that but rebuke and aversion. Is it wonderful that
the tried life, conscious of integrity, rises in indignant
revolt? The taunt of sin, scepticism, rationalism or
self-will is too ready a weapon, a sword worn always
by the side or carried in the hand. Within the House
of God men should not go armed, as if brethren in
Christ might be expected to prove traitors.</p>

<p>The question of the eleventh verse&mdash;"Are the consolations
of God too small for thee?"&mdash;is intended to
cover the whole of the arguments already used by the
friends and is arrogant enough as implying a Divine
commission exercised by them. "The word that dealt
tenderly with thee," says Eliphaz; but Job has his
own idea of the tenderness and seems to convey it
by an expressive gesture or glance which provokes a
retort almost angry from the speaker,&mdash;</p>

repudiation not unmixed with contempt and, at the
same time, not easy to lay hold of. Eliphaz now feels
that he may properly insist on the wickedness of man&mdash;painfully
illustrated in Job himself&mdash;and depict the
certain fate of him who defies the Almighty and trusts
in his own "vanity." The passage is from first to last
repetition, but has new colour of the quasi-prophetic
kind and a certain force and eloquence that give it fresh
interest.</p>

<p>Formerly Eliphaz had said, "Shall man be just beside
God? Behold He putteth no trust in His servants,
and His angels He chargeth with folly." Now, with
a keener emphasis, and adopting Job's own confession
that man born of woman is impure, he asserts the
doctrine of creaturely imperfection and human corruption.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Eloah trusteth not in His holy ones,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the heavens are not pure in His sight;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>How much less the abominable and corrupt,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Man, who drinketh iniquity as water!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>First is set forth the refusal of God to put confidence
in the holiest creature,&mdash;a touch, as it were, of suspicion
in the Divine rule. A statement of the holiness of
God otherwise very impressive is marred by this too
anthropomorphic suggestion. Why, is not the opposite
true, that the Creator puts wonderful trust not only in
saints but in sinners? He trusts men with life, with
the care of the little children whom He loves, with the
use in no small degree of His creation, the powers and
resources of a world. True, there is a reservation.
At no point is the creature allowed to rule. Saint
and sinner, man and angel are alike under law and
observation. None of them can be other than servants,
none of them can ever speak the final word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
do the last thing in any cause. Eliphaz therefore is
dealing with a large truth, one never to be forgotten
or disallowed. Yet he fails to make right use of it, for
his second point, that of the total corruption of human
nature, ought to imply that God does not trust man
at all. The logic is bad and the doctrine will hardly
square with the reference to human wisdom and to
wise persons holding the secret of God of whom
Eliphaz goes on to speak. Against him two lines of
reasoning are evident. Abominable, gone sour or
putrid, to whom evil is a necessary of existence like
water&mdash;if man be that, his Creator ought surely to
sweep him away and be done with him. But since, on
the other hand, God maintains the life of human beings
and honours them with no small confidence, it would
seem that man, sinful as he is, bad as he often is, does
not lie under the contempt of his Maker, is not set
beyond a service of hope. In short, Eliphaz sees only
what he chooses to see. His statements are devout
and striking, but too rigid for the manifoldness of life.
He makes it felt, even while he speaks, that he himself
in some way stands apart from the race he judges so
hardly. So far as the inspiration of this book goes, it
is against the doctrine of total corruption as put into
the mouth of Eliphaz. He intends a final and crushing
assault on the position taken up by Job; but his mind
is prejudiced, and the man he condemns is God's
approved servant, who, in the end, will have to pray
for Eliphaz that he may not be dealt with after his
folly. Quotation of the words of Eliphaz in proof of
total depravity is a grave error. The race is sinful;
all men sin, inherit sinful tendencies and yield to them:
who does not confess it? But,&mdash;all men abominable
and corrupt, drinking iniquity as water,&mdash;that is untrue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
at any rate of the very person Eliphaz engages to
convict.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that there is not a single word of
personal confession in any speech made by the friends.
They are concerned merely to state a creed supposed
to be honouring to God, a full justification from their
point of view of His dealings with men. The sovereignty
of God must be vindicated by attributing this entire
vileness to man, stripping the creature of every claim
on the consideration of his Maker. The great evangelical
teachers have not so driven home their reasoning.
Augustine began with the evil in his own heart and
reasoned to the world, and Jonathan Edwards in the
same way began with himself. "My wickedness," he
says, "has long appeared to me perfectly ineffable and,
swallowing up all thought and imagination, like an
infinite deluge or mountains over my head. I know
not how to express better what my sins appear to me
to be than by heaping infinite on infinite and multiplying
infinite by infinite." Here is no Eliphaz arguing from
misfortune to sinfulness; and indeed by that line it is
impossible ever to arrive at evangelical poverty of spirit.</p>

<p>Passing to his final contention here the speaker
introduces it with a special claim to attention. Again
it is what "he has seen" he will declare, what indeed
all wise men have seen from time immemorial.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I will inform thee: hear me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And what I have seen I will declare:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Things which wise men have told,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>From their fathers, and have not hid,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To whom alone the land was given,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And no stranger passed in their midst.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is the pride. He has a peculiar inheritance of
unsophisticated wisdom. The pure Temanite race has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
dwelt always in the same land, and foreigners have
not mixed with it. With it, therefore, is a religion not
perverted by alien elements or the adoption of sceptical
ideas from passing strangers. The plea is distinctively
Arabic and may be illustrated by the self-complacent
dogmatism of the Wahh&#257;bees of Ri'ad, whom Mr.
Palgrave found enjoying their own uncorrupted orthodoxy.
"In central Nejed society presents an element
pervading it from its highest to its lowest grades. Not
only as a Wahh&#257;bee but equally as a Nejdean the
native of 'Aared and Yem&#257;mah differs, and that widely,
from his fellow-Arab of Shomer and Kaseem, nay, of
Woshem and Sedeyr. The cause of this difference
is much more ancient than the epoch of the great
Wahh&#257;bee, and must be sought first and foremost in
the pedigree itself. The descent claimed by the indigenous
Arabs of this region is from the family of Tameen,
a name peculiar to these lands.... Now Benoo-Tameem
have been in all ages distinguished from other
Arabs by strongly drawn lines of character, the object
of the exaggerated praise and of the biting satire
of native poets. Good or bad, these characteristics,
described some thousand years ago, are identical with
the portrait of their real or pretended descendants....
Simplicity is natural to the men of 'Aared and Yem&#257;mah,
independent of Wahh&#257;bee puritanism and the vigour of
its code." ("Central Arabia," pp. 272, 273.) To this
people Nejed is holy, Damascus through which Christians
and other infidels go is a lax disreputable place.
They maintain a strict Mohammedanism from age to age.
In their view, as in that of Eliphaz, the land belongs
to the wise people who have the heavenly treasure and
do not entertain strangers as guides of thought. Infallibility
is a very old and very abiding cult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliphaz drags back his hearers to the penal visitation
of the wicked, his favourite dogma. Once more
it is affirmed that for one who transgresses the law
of God there is nothing but misery, fear and pain.
Though he has a great following he lives in terror of
the destroyer; he knows that calamity will one day
overtake him, and from it there will be no deliverance.
Then he will have to wander in search of bread, his
eyes perhaps put out by his enemy. So trouble and
anguish make him afraid even in his great day. There
is here not a suggestion that conscience troubles him.
His whole agitation is from fear of pain and loss. No
single touch in the picture gives the idea that this
man has any sense of sin.</p>

<p>How does Eliphaz distinguish or imagine the
Almighty distinguishing between men in general,
who are all bad and offensive in their badness, and
this particular "wicked man"? Distinction there
must be. What is it? One must assume, for the
reasoner is no fool, that the settled temper and habit
of a life are meant. Revolt against God, proud opposition
to His will and law, these are the wickedness.
It is no mere stagnant pool of corruption, but a force
running against the Almighty. Very well: Eliphaz
has not only made a true distinction, but apparently
stated for once a true conclusion. Such a man will
indeed be likely to suffer for his arrogance in this life,
although it does not hold that he will be haunted by
fears of coming doom. But analysing the details of
the wicked life in vers. 25-28, we find incoherency.
The question is why he suffers and is afraid.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Because he stretched out his hand against God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And bade defiance to the Almighty;</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He ran upon Him with a neck</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Upon the thick bosses of His bucklers;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Because he covered his face with his fatness</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And made collops of fat on his flanks;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he dwelt in tabooed cities,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In houses which no man ought to inhabit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Destined to become heaps.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eliphaz has narrowed down the whole contention,
so that he may carry it triumphantly and bring Job
to admit, at least in this case, the law of sin and
retribution. It is fair to suppose that he is not
presenting Job's case, but an argument, rather, in
abstract theology, designed to strengthen his own
general position. The author, however, by side lights
on the reasoning shows where it fails. The account
of calamity and judgment, true as it might be in the
main of God-defiant lives running headlong against the
laws of heaven and earth, is confused by the other
element of wickedness&mdash;"Because he hath covered his
face with his fatness," etc. The recoil of a refined
man of pure race from one of gross sensual appetite is
scarcely a fit parallel to the aversion of God from man
stubbornly and insolently rebellious. Further, the
superstitious belief that one was unpardonable who
made his dwelling in cities under the curse of God
(literally, cities <i>cut off</i> or <i>tabooed</i>), while it might be
sincerely put forward by Eliphaz, made another flaw
in his reasoning. Any one in constant terror of judgment
would have been the last to take up his abode
in such accursed habitations. The argument is strong
only in picturesque assertion.</p>

<p>The latter end of the wicked man and his futile
attempts to found a family or clan are presented at the
close of the address. He shall not become rich; that
felicity is reserved for the servants of God. No
plentiful produce shall weigh down the branches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
his olives and vines, nor shall he ever rid himself of
misfortune. As by a flame or hot breath from the
mouth of God his harvest and himself shall be carried
away. The vanity or mischief he sows shall return to
him in vanity or trouble; and before his time, while
life should be still fresh, the full measure of his reward
shall be paid to him. The branch withered and dry,
unripe grapes and the infertile flowers of the olive
falling to the ground point to the want of children or
their early death; for "the company of the godless
shall be barren." The tents of injustice or bribery,
left desolate, shall be burned. The only fruit of the
doomed life shall be iniquity.</p>

<p>One hesitates to accuse Eliphaz of inaccuracy. Yet
the shedding of the petals of the olive is not in itself a
sign of infertility; and although this tree, like others,
often blossoms without producing fruit, yet it is the
constant emblem of productiveness. The vine, again,
may have shed its unripe grapes in Teman; but
usually they wither. It may be feared that Eliphaz
has fallen into the popular speaker's trick of snatching
at illustrations from "something supposed to be
science." His contention is partly sound in its foundation,
but fails like his analogies; and the controversy,
when he leaves off, is advanced not a single step.</p>

<p>If it were comforting to be told of misery and
misfortune, to hear the doom of insolent evil-doers
described again and again in varying terms, then Job
should have been comforted. But his friends had lost
sight of their errand, and he had to recall them to it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I have heard many such things:</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He would have them consider that perpetual harping
on one string is but a sober accomplishment!
Returning one after another to the wicked man, the
godless sinner, crafty, froward, sensual, overbearing,
and his certain fate of disaster and extinction, they
are at once obstinately ungracious and to Job's mind
pitifully inept. He is indisposed to argue afresh with
them, but he cannot refrain from expressing his sorrow
and indeed his indignation that they have offered him a
stone for bread. Excusing themselves they had blamed
him for his indifference to the "consolations of God."
All he had been aware of was their "joining words
together" against him with much shaking of the head.
Was that Divine consolation? Anything, it seemed,
was good enough for him, a man under the stroke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
God. Perhaps he is a little unfair to his comforters.
They cannot drop their creed in order to assuage his
grief. In a sense it would have been easy to murmur
soothing inanities.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One writes that 'Other friends remain,'<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That 'Loss is common to the race'&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Even so: the courteous superficial talk of men who
said, Friend, you are only accidentally afflicted; there
is no stroke of God in this: wait a little till the
shadows pass, and meanwhile let us cheer you by
stories of old times:&mdash;such talk would have served Job
even less than the serious attempt of the friends to settle
the problem. It is therefore with somewhat inconsiderate
irony he blames them for not giving what, if they
had offered it, he would have rejected with scorn.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I also could speak like you;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If your soul were in my soul's stead,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>I could strengthen you with my mouth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the solace of my lips should assuage your grief.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The passage is throughout ironical. No change of
tone occurs in verse 5, as the opening word <i>But</i> in
the English version is intended to imply. Job means,
of course, that such consolation as they were offering
he never would have offered them. It would be easy,
but abhorrent.</p>

<p>So far in sad sarcasm; and then, the sense of desolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
falling too heavily on his mind for banter or
remonstrance, he returns to his complaint. What is
he among men? What is he in himself? What is
he before God? Alone, stricken, the object of fierce
assault and galling reproach. After a pause of sorrowful
thought he resumes the attempt to express his woes,
a final protest before his lips are silent in death. He
cannot hope that speaking will relieve his sorrow or
mitigate his pain. He would prefer to bear on</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In all the silent manliness of grief."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But as yet the appeal he has made to God remains
unanswered, for aught he knows unheard. It appears
therefore his duty to his own reputation and his faith
that he endeavour yet again to break the obstinate
doubts of his integrity which still estrange from him
those who were his friends. He uses indeed language
that will not commend his case but tend to confirm
every suspicion. Were he wise in the world's way
he would refrain from repeating his complaint against
God. Rather would he speak of his misery as a simple
fact of experience and strive to argue himself into submission.
This line he has not taken and never takes.
It is present to his own mind that the hand of God is
against him. Whether men will join him by-and-by
in an appeal from God to God he cannot tell. But
once more all that he sees or seems to see he will
declare. Every step may bring him into more painful
isolation, yet he will proclaim his wrong.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>He is exhausted; he has come to the last stage.
The circle of his family and friends in which he once
stood enjoying the love and esteem of all&mdash;where is it
now? That hold of life is gone. Then, as if in sheer
malice, God has plucked health from him, and doing
so, left a charge of unworthiness. By the sore disease
the Divine hand grasps him, keeps him down. The
emaciation of his body bears witness against him as
an object of wrath. Yes; God is his enemy, and how
terrible an enemy! He is like a savage lion that tears
with his teeth and glares as if in act to devour. With
God, men also, in their degree, persecute and assail
him. People from the city have come out to gaze upon
him. Word has gone round that he is being crushed
by the Almighty for proud defiance and blasphemy.
Men who once trembled before him have smitten him
upon the cheek reproachfully. They gather in groups
to jeer at him. He is delivered into their hands.</p>

<p>But it is God, not men, of whose strange work he
has most bitterly to speak. Words almost fail him
to express what his Almighty Foe has done.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I was at ease, and He brake me asunder;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yea he hath taken me by the neck</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>He hath also set me as His butt,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>He cleaveth my reins asunder and spareth not,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>He runneth upon me like a giant.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Figure after figure expresses the sense of persecution
by one full of resource who cannot be resisted. Job
declares himself to be physically bruised and broken.
The stings and sores of his disease are like arrows
shot from every side that rankle in his flesh. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
like a fortress beleaguered and stormed by some irresistible
enemy. His strength humbled to the dust, his
eyes foul with weeping, the eyelids swollen so that
he cannot see, he lies abased and helpless, stricken
to the very heart. But not in the chastened mood
of one who has done evil and is now brought to
contrite submission. That is as far from him as ever.
The whole account is of persecution, undeserved. He
suffers, but protests still that there is no violence in
his hands, also his prayer is pure. Let neither God
nor man think he is concealing sin and making appeal
craftily. Sincere he is in every word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this point, where Job's impassioned language
might be expected to lead to a fresh outburst against
heaven and earth, one of the most dramatic turns in
the thought of the sufferer brings it suddenly to a
minor harmony with the creation and the Creator.
His excitement is intense. Spiritual eagerness approaches
the highest point. He invokes the earth
to help him and the mountain echoes. He protests
that his claim of integrity has its witness and must
be acknowledged.</p>

<p>For this new and most pathetic effort to reach a
benignant fidelity in God which all his cries have not
yet stirred, the former speeches have made preparation.
Rising from the thought that it was all one to God
whether he lived or died since the perfect and the
wicked are alike destroyed, bewailing the want of
a daysman between him and the Most High, Job in
the tenth chapter touched the thought that his Maker
could not despise the work of His own hands. Again,
in chapter xiv., the possibility of redemption from
Sheol gladdened him for a little. Now, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
shadow of imminent death, he abandons the hope of
deliverance from the under-world. Immediately, if at
all, his vindication must come. And it exists, written
on the breast of earth, open to the heavens, somewhere
in clear words before the Highest. Not vainly
did the speaker in his days of past felicity serve God
with all his heart. The God he then worshipped
heard his prayers, accepted his offerings, made him
glad with a friendship that was no empty dream.
Somewhere his Divine Friend lives still, observes still
his tears and agonies and cries. Those enemies about
him taunting him with sins he never committed, this
horrible malady bearing him down into death;&mdash;God
knows of these, knows them to be cruel and undeserved.
He cries to that God, Eloah of the Elohim, Higher than
the highest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>O Earth, cover not my blood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And let my cry have no resting-place!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Even now, lo! my witness is in heaven,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He that voucheth for me is on high.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My friends scorn me:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Mine eye sheds tears unto God&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That he would right a man against God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And a son of man against his friend.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now&mdash;in the present stage of being, before those years
expire that lead him to the grave&mdash;Job entreats the
vindication which exists in the records of heaven. As
a son of man he pleads, not as one who has any
peculiar claim, but simply as a creature of the Almighty;
and he pleads for the first time with tears. The fact
that earth, too, is besought to help him must not be
overlooked. There is a touch of wide and wistful
emotion, a sense that Eloah must regard the witness
of His world. The thought has its colour from a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
old feeling; it takes us back to primæval faith, and the
dumb longing before faith.</p>

<p>Is there in any sense a deeper depth in the faithfulness
of God, a higher heaven, more difficult to
penetrate, of Divine benignity? Job is making a bold
effort to break that barrier we have already found to
exist in Hebrew thought between God as revealed by
nature and providence and God as vindicator of the
individual life. The man has that in his own heart
which vouches for his life, though calamity and disease
impeach him. And in the heart of God also there
must be a witness to His faithful servant, although,
meanwhile, something interferes with the testimony
God could bear. Job's appeal is to the sun beyond the
rolling clouds to shine. It is there; God is faithful and
true. It will shine. But let it shine <i>now</i>! Human
life is brief and delay will be disastrous. Pathetic
cry&mdash;a struggle against what in ordinary life is the
inexorable. How many have gone the way whence
they shall not return, unheard apparently, unvindicated,
hidden in calumny and shame! And yet Job was
right. The Maker has regard to the work of His
hands.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Job's appeal is this, that beneath
all seeming discord there is one clear note. The
universe is one and belongs to One, from the highest
heaven to the deepest pit. Nature, providence,&mdash;what
are they but the veil behind which the One Supreme
is hidden, the veil God's own hands have wrought?
We see the Divine in the folds of the veil, the marvellous
pictures of the arras. Yet behind is He who
weaves the changing forms, iridescent with colours
of heaven, dark with unutterable mystery. Man is
now in the shadow of the veil, now in the light of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
self-pitying, exultant, in despair, in ecstasy. He would
pass the barrier. It will not yield at his will. It is
no veil now, but a wall of adamant. Yet faith on this
side answers to truth beyond; of this the soul is
assured. The cry is for God to unravel the enigmas
of His own providence, to unfold the principle of His
discipline, to make clear what is perplexing to the mind
and conscience of His thinking, suffering creature.
None but He who weaves the web can withdraw it,
and let the light of eternity shine on the tangles of
time. From God the Concealer to God the Revealer,
from God who hides Himself to God who is Light, in
whom is no darkness at all, we appeal. To pray on&mdash;that
is man's high privilege, man's spiritual life.</p>

<p>So the passage we have read is a splendid utterance
of the wayworn travelling soul conscious of sublime
possibilities,&mdash;shall we not say, certainties? Job is
God-inspired in his cry, not profane, not mad, but
prophetic. For God is a bold dealer with men, and He
likes bold sons. The impeachment we almost shuddered
to hear is not abominable to Him because it is the truth
of a soul. The claim that God is man's witness is the
true courage of faith: it is sincere, and it is justified.</p>

<p>The demand for immediate vindication still urged is
inseparable from the circumstances.</p>

<p>Moving towards the under-world, the fire of his spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
burning low because of his disease, his body preparing
its own grave, the bystanders flouting him with
mockeries under a sense of which his eyes remain
closed in weary endurance, he has need for one to
undertake for him, to give him a pledge of redemption.
But who is there excepting God to whom he can appeal?
What other friend is left? Who else would be surety
for one so forlorn? Against disease and fate, against
the seeming wreck of hope and life, will not God Himself
stand up for His servant? As for the men his friends,
his enemies, the Divine suretyship for Job will recoil
upon them and their cruel taunts. Their hearts are
"hid from understanding," unable to grasp the truth
of the case; "Therefore Thou shalt not exalt them"&mdash;that
is, Thou shalt bring them low. Yes, when God
redeems His pledge, declares openly that He has
undertaken for His servant, the proverb shall be fulfilled&mdash;"He
that giveth his fellows for a prey, even the
eyes of his children shall fail." It is a proverb of the
old way of thinking and carries a kind of imprecation.
Job forgets himself in using it. Yet how, otherwise,
is the justice of God to be invoked against those
who pervert judgment and will not receive the sincere
defence of a dying man?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I am even made a byeword of the populace;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I am become one in whose face they spit:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Mine eye also fails by reason of sorrow.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is apparently parenthetical&mdash;and then Job returns
to the result of the intervention of his Divine Friend.
One reason why God should become his surety is the
pitiable state he is in. But another reason is the new
impetus that will be given to religion, the awakening of
good men out of their despondency, the reassurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of those who are pure in heart, the growth of spiritual
strength in the faithful and true. A fresh light thrown
on providence shall indeed startle and revive the world.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Upright men shall be amazed at this,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>And the righteous shall keep his way,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he that hath clean hands wax stronger and stronger.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With this hope, that his life is to be rescued from darkness
and the faith of the good re-established by the fulfilment
of God's suretyship, Job comforts himself for a
little&mdash;but only for a little, a moment of strength, during
which he has courage to dismiss his friends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>But as for you all, turn ye, and go;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I shall not find a wise man among you.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They have forfeited all claim to his attention. Their
continued discussion of the ways of God will only
aggravate his pain. Let them take their departure then
and leave him in peace.</p>

<p>The final passage of the speech referring to a hope
present to Job's mind has been variously interpreted.
It is generally supposed that the reference is to the promise
held out by the friends that repentance will bring
him relief from trouble and new prosperity. But this
is long ago dismissed. It seems clear that <i>my hope</i>, an
expression twice used, cannot refer to one pressed upon
Job but never accepted. It must denote either the hope
that God would after Job's death lay aside His anger
and forgive, or the hope that God would strike hands
with him and undertake his case against all adverse
forces and circumstances. If this be the meaning, the
course of thought in the last strophe, from verse 11
onward, is the following,&mdash;Life is running to a low ebb
with me, all I had once in my heart to do is arrested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
brought to an end; so gloomy are my thoughts that
they set night for day, the light is near unto darkness.
If I wait till death come and Sheol be my habitation
and my body is given to corruption, where
then shall my hope of vindication be? As for the
fulfilment of my trust in God, who shall see it? The
effort once made to maintain hope even in the face of
death is not forgotten. But he questions now whether
it has the least ground in fact. The sense of bodily
decay masters his brave prevision of a deliverance from
Sheol. His mind needs yet another strain put upon it
before it shall rise to the magnificent assertion&mdash;Without
my flesh I shall see God. The tides of trust ebb
and flow. There is here a low ebb. The next advance
will mark the springtide of resolute belief.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If I wait till Sheol is my house;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Till I have spread my couch in darkness:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If I shall have said to corruption, My father art thou,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To the worm, My mother and my sister&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Where then were my hope?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As for my hope, who shall see it?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When once there is rest in the dust.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How strenuous is the thought that has to fight with
the grave and corruption! The body in its emaciation
and decay, doomed to be the prey of worms, appears
to drag with it into the nether darkness the eager life
of the spirit. Those who have the Christian outlook
to another life may measure by the oppression Job has
to endure the value of that revelation of immortality
which is the gift of Christ.</p>

<p>Not in error, not in unbelief, did a man like Job fight
with grim death, strive to keep it at bay till his
character was cleared. There was no acknowledged
doctrine of the future to found upon. Of sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
necessity each burdened soul had to seek its own
Apocalypse. He who had suffered with bleeding heart
a lifelong sacrifice, he who had striven to free his
fellow-slaves and sank at last overborne by tyrannous
power, the brave defeated, the good betrayed, those
who sought through heathen beliefs and those who
found in revealed religion the promises of God&mdash;all
alike stood in sorrowful ignorance before inexorable
death, beheld the shadows of the under-world and
singly battled for hope amidst the deepening gloom.
The sense of the overwhelming disaster of death to
one whose life and religion are scornfully condemned
is not ascribed to Job as a peculiar trial, rarely mingling
with human experience. The writer of the book
has himself felt it and has seen the shadow of it on
many a face. "Where," as one asks, "were the tears
of God as He thrust back into eternal stillness the
hands stretched out to Him in dying faith?"</p>

<p>There was a religion which gave large and elaborate
answer to the questions of mortality. The wide intelligence
of the author of Job can hardly have missed
the creed and ceremonial of Egypt; he cannot have
failed to remember its "Book of the Dead." His own
work, throughout, is at once a parallel and a contrast
to that old vision of future life and Divine judgment.
It has been affirmed that some of the forms of expression,
especially in the nineteenth chapter, have their
source in the Egyptian scripture, and that the "Book
of the Dead" is full of spiritual aspirations which
give it a striking resemblance to the Book of Job.
Now, undoubtedly, the correspondence is remarkable
and will bear examination. The soul comes before
Osiris, who holds the shepherd's crook and the penal
scourge. Thoth (or Logos) breathes new spirit into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the embalmed body, and the dead pleads for himself
before the assessors&mdash;"Hail to thee, great Lord of
Justice. I arrive near thee. I am one of those consecrated
to thee on the earth. I reach the land of
eternity. I rejoin the eternal country. Living is he
who dwelleth in darkness; all his grandeurs live."
The dead is in fact not dead, he is recreated; <i>the mouth
of no worm shall devour him</i>. At the close of the
"Book of the Dead" it is written, the departed
"shall be among the gods; his flesh and bones shall
be healthy as one who is not dead. He shall shine
as a star for ever and ever. He seeth God with his
flesh." The defence of the soul in claiming beatitude
is this: "I have committed no revenge in act or in
heart, no excesses in love. I have injured no one with
lies. I have driven away no beggars, committed no
treacheries, caused no tears. I have not taken
another's property, nor ruined another, nor destroyed
the laws of righteousness. I have not aroused contests,
nor neglected the Creator of my soul. I have
not disturbed the joy of others. I have not passed by
the oppressed, sinning against my Creator, or the
Lord, or the heavenly powers.... I am pure, pure."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>There are many evident resemblances which have
been already studied and would repay further attention;
but the questions occur, how far the author of the
Book of Job refused Egyptian influences, and why, in
the face of a solution of his problem apparently thrust
upon him with the authority of ages, he yet exerted
himself to find a solution of his own, meanwhile
throwing his hero into the hopelessness of one to
whom death as a physical fact is final, compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
forego the expectation of a daysman who should
affirm his righteousness before the Lord of all. The
"Book of the Dead" was, for one thing, identified
with polytheism, with idolatry and a priestly system;
and a thinker whose belief was entirely monotheistic,
whose mind turned decisively from ritual, whose
interests were widely humane, was not likely to accept
as a revelation the promises of Egyptian priests to
their aristocratic patrons, or to seek light from the
mysteries of Isis and Osiris. Throughout his book
our author is advancing to a conclusion altogether
apart from the ideas of Egyptian faith regarding the
trust of the soul. But chiefly his mind seems to have
been repelled by the excessive care given to the dead
body, with the consequent materialising of religion.
Life to him meant so much that he needed a far more
spiritual basis for its continuance than could be
found in the preservation of the worn-out frame.
With rare and unsurpassed endeavour he was straining
beyond time and sense after a vision of life in the
union of man's spirit with its Maker, and that Divine
constancy in which alone faith could have acceptance
and repose. No thought of maintaining himself in
existence by having his body embalmed is ever expressed
by Job. The author seems to scorn that
childish dream of continuance. Death means decay,
corruption. This doom passed on the body the
stricken life must endure, and the soul must stay itself
upon the righteousness and grace of God.</p>

<p class="center"><i>A SCHEME OF WORLD-RULE.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Bildad speaks. Chap.</span> xviii.</p>


<p>Composed in the orderly parallelism of the
finished <i>mashal</i>, this speech of Bildad stands out
in its strength and subtlety and, no less, in its cruel
rigour quite distinct among those addressed to Job.
It is the most trenchant attack the sufferer has to
bear. The law of retribution is stated in a hard
collected tone which seems to leave no room for doubt.
The force that overbears and kills is presented rather
as fate or destiny than as moral government. No
attempt is made to describe the character of the man
on whom punishment falls. We hear nothing of proud
defiance or the crime of settling in habitations under
the Divine curse. Bildad ventures no definitions that
may not fit Job's case. He labels a man godless, and
then, with a dogged relish, follows his entanglement in
the net of disaster. All he says is general, abstract;
nevertheless, the whole of it is calculated to pierce the
armour of Job's supposed presumption. It is not to
be borne longer that against all wisdom and certainty
this man, plainly set among the objects of wrath, should
go on defending himself as if the judgment of men and
God went for nothing.</p>

<p>With singular inconsistency the wicked man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
spoken of as one who for some time prospers in the
world. He has a settlement from which he is ejected,
a family that perishes, a name of some repute which he
loses. Bildad begins by admitting what he afterwards
denies, that a man of evil life may have success. It is
indeed only for a time, and perhaps the idea is that he
becomes wicked as he becomes rich and strong. Yet
if the effect of prosperity is to make a man proud and
cruel and so bring him at once into snares and pitfalls
according to a rigorous natural law&mdash;how then can
worldly success be the reward of virtue? Bildad is
nearer the mark with description than with reasoning.
It is as though he said to Job, Doubtless you were a
good man once; you were my friend and a servant of
God; but I very much fear that prosperity has done
you harm. It is clear that, as a godless man, you are
now driven from light into darkness, that fear and
death wait for you. The speaker does not see that he
is overturning his own scheme of world-rule.</p>

<p>There is bitterness here, the personal feeling of one
who has a view to enforce. Does the man before him
think he is of such account that the Almighty will intervene
to become surety for him and justify his self-righteousness?
It is necessary that Job shall not even seem
to get the best of the argument. No bystander shall
say his novel heresies appear to have a colour of truth.
The speaker is accordingly very unlike what he was in
his first address. The show of politeness and friendship
is laid aside. We see the temper of a mind fed
on traditional views of truth, bound in the fetters of
self-satisfied incompetence. In his admirable exposition
of this part of the book Dr. Cox cites various
Arabic proverbs of long standing which are embodied,
one way or other, in Bildad's speech. It is a cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
creed which builds on this wisdom of the world. He
who can use grim sayings against others is apt to think
himself superior to their frailties, in no danger of the
penalties he threatens. And the speech of Bildad is
irritating just because everything is omitted which
might give a hinge or loop to Job's criticism.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the skill of the author better shown than
in making these protagonists of Job say false things
plausibly and effectively. His resources are marvellous.
After the first circle of speeches the lines of opposition
to Job marked out by the tenor of the controversy
might seem to admit no more or very little fresh argument.
Yet this address is as graphic and picturesque
as those before it. The full strength of the opposition
is thrown into those sentences piling threat on threat
with such apparent truth. The reason is that the crisis
approaches. By Bildad's attack the sufferer is to be
roused to his loftiest effort,&mdash;that prophetic word which
is in one sense the <i>raison d'être</i> of the book. One
may say the work done here is for all time. The
manifesto of humanity against rabbinism, of the plain
man's faith against hard theology, is set beside the
most specious arguments for a rule dividing men into
good and bad, simply as they appear to be happy or
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Bildad opens the attack by charging Job with hunting
for words&mdash;an accusation of a general kind apparently
referring to the strong expressions he had used
in describing his sufferings at the hand of God and
from the criticism of men. He then calls Job to
understand his own errors, that he may be in a position
to receive the truth. Perverting and exaggerating the
language of Job, he demands why the friends should be
counted as beasts and unclean, and why they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
be so branded by a man who was in revolt against
providence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Why are we counted as beasts,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As unclean even in your sight?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For thy sake shall the earth be forsaken,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the rock be moved from its place?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ewald's interpretation here brings out the force of
the questions. "Does this madman who complained
that God's wrath tore him, but who, on the contrary,
sufficiently betrays his own bad conscience by tearing
himself in his anger, really demand that on his account,
that he may be justified, the earth shall be made desolate
(since really, if God Himself should pervert justice,
order, and peace, the blessings of the happy occupation
of the earth could not subsist)? Does he also hope that
what is firmest, the Divine order of the world, should
be removed from its place? Oh, the fool, who in his
own perversity and confusion rebels against the everlasting
order of the universe!" All is settled from
time immemorial by the laws of providence. Without
more discussion Bildad reaffirms what the unchangeable
decree, as he knows it, certainly is.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Nevertheless the light of the wicked shall be put out,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the gleam of his fire shall not shine.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The light shall fade in his tent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And his lamp over him shall be put out,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The steps of his strength shall be straitened,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And his own counsel shall cast him down.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For into a net his own feet urge him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he walketh over the toils.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>A snare seizeth him by the heel,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And a noose holdeth him fast:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In the ground its loop is hidden,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And its mesh in the path.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By reiteration, by a play on words the fact as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
appears to Bildad is made very clear&mdash;that for the
wicked man the world is full of perils, deliberately
prepared as snares for wild animals are set by the
hunter. The general proposition is that the light of
his prosperity is an accident. It shall soon be put out
and his home be given to desolation. This comes to
pass first by a restraint put on his movements. The
sense of some inimical power observing him, pursuing
him, compels him to move carefully and no longer with
the free stride of security. Then in the narrow range
to which he is confined he is caught again and again
by the snares and meshes set for him by invisible hands.
His best devices for his own safety bring him into peril.
In the open country and in the narrow path alike he is
seized and held fast. More and more closely the adverse
power confines him, bearing upon his freedom and his
life till his superstitious fears are kindled. Terrors
confound him now on every side and suddenly presented
startle him to his feet. This once strong man
becomes weak; he who had abundance knows what it
is to hunger. And death is now plainly in his cup.
Destruction, a hateful figure, is constantly at his side,
appearing as disease which attacks the body. It is
leprosy, the very disease Job is suffering.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>It devoureth the members of his skin,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Devoureth his members, even the firstborn of death.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He is plucked from the tent of his confidence,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he is brought to the king of terrors.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The personification of death here is natural, and many
parallels to the figure are easily found. Horror of death
is a mark of strong healthy life, especially among
those who see beyond only some dark Sheol of dreary
hopeless existence. The "firstborn of death" is the
frightful black leprosy, and it has that figurative name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
as possessing more than other diseases that power to
corrupt the body which death itself fully exercises.</p>

<p>This cold prediction of the death of the godless from
the very malady that has attacked Job is cruel indeed,
especially from the lips of one who formerly promised
health and felicity in this world as the result of penitence.
We may say that Bildad has found it his duty
to preach the terrors of God, and the duty appears congenial
to him, for he describes with insistence and
ornament the end of the godless. But he should have
deferred this terrible homily till he had clear proof of
Job's wickedness. Bildad says things in the zeal of
his spirit against the godless which he will afterwards
bitterly regret.</p>

<p>Having brought the victim of destiny to the grave,
the speaker has yet more to say. There were consequences
that extended beyond a man's own suffering
and extinction. His family, his name, all that was
desired of remembrance in this world would be denied
to the evil-doer. In the universe, as Bildad sees it, there
is no room for repentance or hope even to the children
of the man against whom the decree of fate has gone
forth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>They shall dwell in his tent that are none of his:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Brimstone shall be showered on his habitation;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>His roots shall be dried up beneath,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And above his branches shall wither;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>His memory shall perish from the land,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he shall have no name in the earth&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>It shall be driven from light into darkness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And chased out of the world.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The habitation of the sinner shall either pass into the
hand of utter strangers or be covered with brimstone
and made accursed. The roots of his family or clan,
those who still survive of an older generation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
branches above&mdash;children or grandchildren, as in verse
19&mdash;shall wither away. So his memory shall perish,
alike in the land where he dwelt and abroad in other
regions. His name shall go into oblivion, chased with
aversion and disgust out of the world. Such, says
Bildad, is the fate of the wicked. Job saw fit to speak
of men being astonished at the vindication he was to
enjoy when God appeared for him. But the surprise
would be of a different kind. At the utter destruction
of the wicked man and his seed, his homestead and
memory, they of the west would be astonished and
they of the east affrighted.</p>

<p>As logical as many another scheme since offered to
the world, a moral scheme also, this of Bildad is at
once determined and incoherent. He has no doubt,
no hesitation in presenting it. Were he the moral
governor, there would be no mercy for sinners who
refused to be convicted of sin in his way and according
to his law of judgment. He would lay snares for them,
hunt them down, snatch at every argument against
them. In his view that is the only way to overcome
unregenerate hearts and convince them of guilt. In
order to save a man he would destroy him. To make
him penitent and holy he would attack his whole right
to live. Of the humane temper Bildad has almost
none.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>MY REDEEMER LIVETH.</i>"<br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chap.</span> xix.</p>


<p>With simple strong art sustained by exuberant
eloquence the author has now thrown his hero
upon our sympathies, blending a strain of expectancy
with tender emotion. In shame and pain, sick almost to
death, baffled in his attempts to overcome the seeming
indifference of Heaven, the sufferer lies broken and
dejected. Bildad's last address describing the fate of
the godless man has been deliberately planned to strike
at Job under cover of a general statement of the method
of retribution. The pictures of one seized by the
"firstborn of death," of the lightless and desolate
habitation, the withered branches and decaying remembrance
of the wicked, are plainly designed to reflect
Job's present state and forecast his coming doom. At
first the effect is almost overwhelming. The judgment
of men is turned backward and like the forces of nature
and providence has become relentless. The united
pressure on a mind weakened by the body's malady
goes far to induce despair. Meanwhile the sufferer
must endure the burden not only of his personal
calamities and the alienation of all human friendships,
but also of a false opinion with which he has to grapple
as much for the sake of mankind as for his own. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
represents the seekers after the true God and true
religion in an age of darkness, aware of doubts other
men do not admit, labouring after a hope of which
the world feels no need. The immeasurable weight
this lays on the soul is to many unknown. Some few
there are, as Carlyle says, and Job appears one of them,
who "have to realise a worship for themselves, or live
unworshipping. In dim forecastings, wrestles within
them the 'Divine Idea of the World,' yet will nowhere
visibly reveal itself. The Godlike has vanished from
the world; and they, by the strong cry of their soul's
agony, like true wonder-workers, must again evoke its
presence.... The doom of the Old has long been
pronounced, and irrevocable; the Old has passed away;
but, alas, the New appears not in its stead, the Time
is still in pangs of travail with the New. Man has
walked by the light of conflagrations and amid the
sound of falling cities; and now there is darkness, and
long watching till it be morning. The voice of the
faithful can but exclaim: 'As yet struggles the twelfth
hour of the night: birds of darkness are on the wing,
spectres uproar, the dead walk, the living dream.
Thou, Eternal Providence, wilt cause the day to
dawn.'"</p>

<p>As in the twelfth hour of the night, the voices of
men sounding hollow and strange to him, the author
of the Book of Job found himself. Current ideas
about God would have stifled his thought if he had
not realised his danger and the world's danger and
thrown himself forward, breaking through, even with
defiance and passion, to make a way for reason to the
daylight of God. Limiting and darkening statements
he took up as they were presented to him over and
over again; he tracked them to their sources in ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
pedantry, hardness of temper. He insisted that
the one thing for a man is resolute clearness of mind,
openness to the teaching of God, to the correction of
the Almighty, to that truth of the whole world which
alone corresponds to faith. Believing that the ultimate
satisfying object of faith will disclose itself at last to
every pure seeker, each in his degree, he began his
quest and courageously pursued it, never allowing hope
to wander where reason dared not follow, checking
himself on the very brink of alluring speculation by a
deliberate <i>reconnaissance</i> of the facts of life and the
limitations of knowledge. Nowhere more clearly than
in this speech of Job does the courageous truthfulness
of the author show itself. He seems to find his oracle,
and then with a sigh return to the path of sober reality
because as yet verification of the sublime idea is beyond
his power. The vision appears and is fixed in a vivid
picture&mdash;marking the highest flight of his inspiration&mdash;that
those who follow may have it before them, to be
examined, tried, perhaps approved in the long run.
But for himself, or at any rate for his hero, one who
has to find his faith through the natural world and its
revelations of Divine faithfulness, the bounds within
which absolute certainty existed for the human mind
at that time are accepted unflinchingly. The hope
remains; but assurance is sought on a lower level,
where the Divine order visible in the universe sheds
light on the moral life of man.</p>

<p>That inspiration should thus work within bounds,
conscious of itself, yet restrained by human ignorance,
may be questioned. The apprehension of transcendent
truth not yet proved by argument, the authoritative
statement of such truth for the guidance and confirmation
of faith, lastly, complete independence of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
criticism&mdash;are not these the functions and qualities of
inspiration? And yet, here, the inspired man, with
insight fresh and marvellous, declines to allow his hero
or any thinker repose in the very hope which is the
chief fruit of his inspiration, leaving it as something
thrown out, requiring to be tested and verified; and
meanwhile he takes his stand as a prophet on those
nearer, in a sense more common, yet withal sustaining
principles that are within the range of the ordinary
mind. Such we shall find to be the explanation of the
speeches of the Almighty and their absolute silence
regarding the future redemption. Such also may be
said to be the reason of the epilogue, apparently so
inconsistent with the scope of the poem. On firm
ground the writer takes his stand&mdash;ground which no
thinker of his time could declare to be hollow. The
thorough saneness of his mind, shown in this final
decision, gives all the more life to the flashes of prediction
and the Divine intuitions which leap out of the
dark sky hanging low over the suffering man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The speech of Bildad in chap. xviii., under cover
of an account of invariable law was really a dream of
special providence. He believed that the Divine King,
who, as Christ teaches, "maketh His sun to rise on
the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and
the unjust," really singles out the wicked for peculiar
treatment corresponding to their iniquity. It is in one
sense the sign of vigorous faith to attribute action of
this kind to God, and Job himself in his repeated
appeals to the unseen Vindicator shows the same
conception of providence. Should not One intent on
righteousness break through the barriers of ordinary
law when doubt is cast on His equity and care? Pardonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to Job, whose case is altogether exceptional,
the notion is one the author sees it necessary to hold
in check. There is no Theophany of the kind Job
desires. On the contrary his very craving for special
intervention adds to his anxiety. Because it is not
granted he affirms that God has perverted his right;
and when at last the voice of the Almighty is heard,
it is to recall the doubter from his personal desires to
the contemplation of the vast universe as revealing a
wide and wise fidelity. This undernote of the author's
purpose, while it serves to guide us in the interpretation
of Job's complaints, is not allowed to rise into the
dominant. Yet it rebukes those who think the great
Divine laws have not been framed to meet their case,
who rest their faith not on what God does always and
is in Himself, but on what they believe He does
sometimes and especially for them. The thoughts of
the Lord are very deep. Our lives float upon them
like skiffs upon an unfathomable ocean of power and
fatherly care.</p>

<p>Of the treatment he receives from men Job complains,
yet not because they are the means of his
overthrow.</p>

<span class="i1"><i>And compassed me about with His net.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Why should his friends be so persistent in charging
him with offence? He has not wronged them. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
has erred, he himself is the sufferer. It is not for them
to take part against him. Their exultation is of a
kind they have no right to indulge, for they have not
brought him to the misery in which he lies. Bildad
spoke of the snare in which the wicked is caught.
His tone in that passage could not have been more
complacent if he himself claimed the honour of bringing
retribution on the godless. But it is God, says Job,
who hath compassed me with His net.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold, of wrong I cry, but I am not heard;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I cry for help, but there is no judgment.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Day after day, night after night, pains and fears
increase: death draws nearer. He cannot move out
of the net of misery. As one neglected, outlawed, he
has to bear his inexplicable doom, his way fenced in
so that he cannot pass, darkness thrown over his world
by the hand of God.</p>

<p>Plunging thus anew into a statement of his hopeless
condition as one discrowned, dishonoured, a broken
man, the speaker has in view all along the hard human
judgment which numbers him with the godless. He
would melt the hearts of his relentless critics by
pleading that their enmity is out of place. If the
Almighty is his enemy and has brought him near to
the dust of death, why should men persecute him as
God? Might they not have pity? There is indeed
resentment against providence in his mind; but the
anxious craving for human sympathy reacts on his
language and makes it far less fierce and bitter than
in previous speeches. Grief rather than revolt is now
his mood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1"><i>And cast up their way against me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And encamp around my tent.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So far the Divine indignation has gone. Will his
friends not think of it? Will they not look upon him
with less of hardness and contempt though he may have
sinned? A man in a hostile universe, a feeble man,
stricken with disease, unable to help himself, the
heavens frowning upon him&mdash;why should they harden
their hearts?</p>

<p>And yet, see how his brethren have dealt with him!
Mark how those who were his friends stand apart,
Eliphaz and the rest, behind them others who once
claimed kinship with him. How do they look? Their
faces are clouded. They must be on God's side against
Job. Yea, God Himself has moved them to this.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The picture is one of abject humiliation. He is rejected

jeered at even by children of the place. The
case appears to us unnatural and shows the almost
fiendish hardness of the Oriental world; that is to say,
if the account is not coloured for dramatic purposes.
The intention is to represent the extremity of Job's
wretchedness, the lowest depth to which he is reduced.
The fire of his spirit is almost quenched by
shame and desolation. He shows the days of his
misery in the strongest shadow in order to compel, if
possible, the sympathy so persistently withheld.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>And are not satisfied with my flesh?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Now we understand the purpose of the long description
of his pain, both that which God has inflicted and
that caused by the alienation and contempt of men.
Into his soul the prediction of Bildad has entered, that
he will share the fate of the wicked whose memory
perishes from the earth, whose name is driven from
light into darkness and chased out of the world. Is
it to be so with him? That were indeed a final
disaster. To bring his friends to some sense of what
all this means to him&mdash;this is what he struggles after.
It is not even the pity of it that is the chief point,
although through that he seeks to gain his end. But
if God is not to interpose, if his last hour is coming
without a sign of heaven's relenting, he would at least
have men stand beside him, take his words to heart,
believe them possibly true, hand down for his memorial
the claim he has made of integrity. Surely, surely
he shall not be thought of by the next generation as
Job the proud defiant evil-doer laid low by the judgments
of an offended God&mdash;brought to shame as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
who deserved to be counted amongst the offscourings
of the earth. It is enough that God has persecuted
him, that God is slaying him&mdash;let not men take it upon
them to do so to the last. Before he dies let one at
least say, Job, my friend, perhaps you are sincere,
perhaps you are misjudged.</p>

<p>Urgent is the appeal. It is in vain. Not a hand is
stretched out, not one grim face relaxes. The man
has made his last attempt. He is now like a pressed
animal between the hunter and the chasm. And why
is the author so rigorous in his picture of the friends?
It is made to all appearance quite inhuman, and cannot
be so without design. By means of this inhumanity
Job is flung once for all upon his need of God from
whom he had almost turned away to man. The poet
knows that not in man is the help of the soul, that not
in the sympathy of man, not in the remembrance of
man, not in the care or even love of man as a passing
tenant of earth can the labouring heart put its confidence.
From the human judgment Job turned to God
at first. From the Divine silence he had well-nigh
turned back to human pity. He finds what other
sufferers have found, that the silence is allowed to
extend beneath him, between him and his fellows, in
order that he may finally and effectually direct his hope
and faith above himself, above the creaturely race, to
Him from whom all came, in whose will and love alone
the spirit of man has its life, its hope. Yes, God is
bringing home to Himself the man whom He has
approved for approval. The way is strange to the
feet of Job, as it often is to the weary half-blinded
pilgrim. But it is the one way to fulfil and transcend
our longings. Neither corporate sympathy nor posthumous
immortality can ever stand to a thinking soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
instead of the true firm judgment of its life that waits
within the knowledge of God. If He is not for us,
the epitaphs and memoirs of time avail nothing. Man's
place is in the eternal order or he does indeed cry out
of wrong and is not heard.</p>

<p>From men to the written book, from men to the
graven rock, more enduring, more public than the
book&mdash;will this provide what is still unfound?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Oh that now my words were written,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That they were inscribed in a book;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That with an iron stylus and with lead</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They were graven in the rock for ever.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As one accustomed to the uses of wealth Job speaks.
He thinks first of a parchment in which his story and
his claim may be carefully written and preserved.
But he sees at once how perishable that would be and
passes to a form of memorial such as great men
employed. He imagines a cliff in the desert with a
monumental inscription bearing that once he, the
Emeer of Uz, lived and suffered, was thrown from
prosperity, was accused by men, was worn by disease,
but died maintaining that all this befel him unjustly,
that he had done no wrong to God or man. It would
stand there in the way of the caravans of Tema for
succeeding generations to read. It would stand there
till the ages had run their course. Kings represent on
rocks their wars and triumphs. As one of royal dignity
Job would use the same means of continuing his protest
and his name.</p>

<p>Yet, so far as his life is concerned, what good,&mdash;the
story spread northward to Damascus, but he, Job, lost
in Sheol? His protest is against forms of death; his
claim is for life. There is no life in the sculptured
stone. Baffled again he halts midway. His foot on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
a crumbling point, there must be yet one spring for
safety and refuge.</p>

<p>Who has not felt, looking at the records of the past,
inscriptions on tablets, rocks and temples, the wistful
throb of antiquity in those anxious legacies of a world
of men too well aware of man's forgetfulness? "Whoever
alters the work of my hand," says the conqueror
called Sargon, "destroys my constructions, pulls down
the walls which I have raised&mdash;may Asshur, Ninêb,
Ramân and the great gods who dwell there pluck his
name and seed from the land and let him sit bound at
the feet of his foe." Invocation of the gods in this
manner was the only resource of him who in that far
past feared oblivion and knew that there was need to
fear. But to a higher God, in words of broken eloquence,
Job is made to commit his cause, seeing beyond
the perishable world the imperishable remembrance of
the Almighty. So a Hebrew poet breathed into the
wandering air of the desert that brave hope which afterwards,
far beyond his thought, was in Israel to be
fulfilled. Had he been exiled from Galilee? In Galilee
was to be heard the voice that told of immortality and
redemption.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must go back in the book to find the beginning
of the hope now seized. Already Job has been looking
forth beyond the region of this little life. What has
he seen?</p>

<p>First and always, Eloah. That name and what it
represents do not fail him. He has had terrible experiences,
and all of them must have been appointed by
Eloah. But the name is venerable still, and despite all
difficulties he clings to the idea that righteousness goes
with power and wisdom. The power bewilders&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
wisdom plans inconceivable things&mdash;but beyond there
is righteousness.</p>

<p>Next. He has seen a gleam of light across the
darkness of the grave, through the gloom of the under-world.
A man going down thither,&mdash;his body to
moulder into dust, his spirit to wander a shadow in
a prison of shadows,&mdash;may not remain there. God is
almighty&mdash;He has the key of Sheol&mdash;a star has shown
for a little, giving hope that out of the under-world life
may be recovered. It is seen that Eloah, the Maker,
must have a desire to the work of His hands. What
does that not mean?</p>

<p>Again. It has been borne upon his mind that the
record of a good life abides and is with the All-seeing.
What is done cannot be undone. The wasting of the
flesh cannot waste that Divine knowledge. The eternal
history cannot be effaced. Spiritual life is lived before
Eloah who guards the right of a man. Men scorn Job;
but with tears he has prayed to Eloah to right his
cause, and that prayer cannot be in vain.</p>

<p>A just prayer cannot be in vain because God is ever
just. From this point thought mounts upward. Eloah
for ever faithful&mdash;Eloah able to open the gate of Sheol&mdash;not
angry for ever&mdash;Eloah keeping the tablet of every
life, indifferent to no point of right,&mdash;these are the steps
of progress in Job's thought and hope. And these are
the gain of his trial. In his prosperous time none of
these things had been before him. He had known the
joy of God but not the secret, the peace not the righteousness.
Yet he is not aware how much he has
gained. He is coming half unconsciously to an inheritance
prepared for him in wisdom and in love by
Eloah in whom he trusts. A man needs for life more
than he himself can either sow or ripen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, hear Job. Whether the rock shall be
graven or not he cannot tell. Does it matter? He
sees far beyond that inscribed cliff in the desert. He
sees what alone can satisfy the spirit that has learned
to live.</p>

<p>Not dimly this great truth flashes through the web of

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The Goël or Redeemer pledged to him by eternal
justice is yet to arise, a living Remembrancer and
Vindicator from all wrong and dishonour. On the
dust that covers death He will arise when the day
comes. The diseases that prey on the perishing body
shall have done their work. In the grave the flesh
shall have passed into decay; but the spirit that has
borne shall behold Him. Not for the passing stranger
shall be the vindication, but for Job himself. All that
has been so confounding shall be explained, for the
Most High is the Goël; He has the care of His suffering
servant in His own hand and will not fail to issue
it in clear satisfying judgment.</p>

<p>For the inspired writer of these words, declaring
the faith which had sprung up within him; for us also
who desire to share his faith and to be assured of the
future vindication, three barriers stand in the way, and
these have successively to be passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>First is the difficulty of believing that the Most High
need trouble Himself to disentangle all the rights from
the wrongs in human life. Is humanity of such importance
in the universe? God is very high; human affairs
may be of little consequence to His eternal majesty.
Is not this earth on which we dwell one of the smaller
of the planets that revolve about the sun? Is not
our sun one amongst a myriad, many of them far
transcending it in size and splendour? Can we demand
or even feel hopeful that the Eternal Lord shall
adjust the disordered equities of our little state
and appear for the right which has been obscured in
the small affairs of time? A century is long to us;
but our ages are "moments in the being of the eternal
silence." Can it matter to the universe moving through
perpetual cycles of evolution, new races and phases
of creaturely life arising and running their course&mdash;can
it matter that one race should pass away having simply
contributed its struggle and desire to the far-off result?
Conceivably, in the design of a wise and good Creator,
this might be a destiny for a race of beings to subserve.
How do we know it is not ours?</p>

<p>This difficulty has grown. It stands now in the
way of all religion, even of the Christian faith. God
is among the immensities and eternities; evolution
breaks in wave after wave; we are but one. How
can we assure our hearts that the inexterminable
longing for equity shall have fulfilment?</p>

<p>Next there is the difficulty which belongs to the
individual life. To enjoy the hope, feel the certainty to
which Job reached forth, you or I must make the bold
assumption that our personal controversies are of eternal
importance. One is obscure; his life has moved in
a very narrow circle. He has done little, he knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
little. His sorrows have been keen, but they are
brief and limited. He has been held down, scorned,
afflicted. But after all why should God care? To
adjust the affairs of nations, to bring out the world's
history in righteousness may be God's concern. But
suppose a man lives bravely, bears patiently, preserves
his life from evil, though he have to suffer and even
go down in darkness, may not the end of the righteous
King be gained by the weight his life casts into the
scale of faith and virtue? Should not the man be
satisfied with this result of his energy and look for
nothing more? Does eternal righteousness demand
anything more on behalf of a man? Included in this is
the question whether the disputes between men, the
small ignorances, egotisms, clashing of wills, need a final
assize. Are they not trifling and transient? Can we
affirm that in these is involved an element of justice
which it concerns our Maker to establish before the
worlds?</p>

<p>The third barrier is not less than the others to
modern thought. How is our life to be preserved or
revived, so that personally and consciously we shall
have our share in the clearing up of the human story
and be gladdened by the "Well done, good and faithful
servant" of the Judge? That verdict is entirely
personal; but how may the faithful servant live to hear
it? Death appears inexorable. Despite the resurrection
of Christ, despite the words He has spoken, "I am the
resurrection and the life," even to Christians the vision
is often clouded, the survival of consciousness hard to
believe in. How did the author of Job pass this barrier&mdash;in
thought, or in hope? Are we content to pass
it only in hope?</p>

<p>I answer all these questions together. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
answer lies in the very existence of the idea of justice,
our knowledge of justice, our desire for it, the fragmentariness
of our history till right has been done to us by
others, by us to others, by man to God, and God to
man&mdash;the full right, whatever that may involve.</p>

<p>Whence came our sense of justice? We can only
say, From Him who made us. He gave us such a
nature as cannot be satisfied nor find rest till an ideal
of justice, that is of acted truth, is framed in our human
life and everything possible done to realise it. Upon
this acted truth all depends, and till it is reached we
are in suspense. Deep in the mind of man lies that
need. Yet it is always a hunger. More and more
it unsettles him, keeps him in unrest, turning from
scheme to scheme of ethic and society. He is ever
making compromises, waiting for evolutions; but nature
knows no compromises and gives him no clue save in
present fact. Is it possible that He who made us will
not overpass our poor best, will not sweep aside the
shifts and evasions current in our imperfect economy?
The passion for righteousness comes from him; it is a
ray of Himself. The soul of the good man craving
perfect holiness and toiling for it in himself, in others,
can it be greater than God, more strenuous, more
subtle than the Divine evolution that gave him birth,
the Divine Father of his spirit? Impossible in thought,
impossible in fact.</p>

<p>No. Justice there is in every matter. Surely science
has taught us very little if it has not banished the notion
that the <i>small</i> means the <i>unimportant</i>, that minute things
are of no moment in evolution. For many years past
science has been constructing for us the great argument
of universal physical fidelity, universal weaving of the
small details into the vast evolutionary design. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
microscopist, the biologist, the chemist, the astronomer,
each and all are engaged in building up this argument,
forcing the confession that the universe is one of
inconceivably small things ordered throughout by law.
Finish and care would seem to be given everywhere
to minutiæ as though, that being done, the great would
certainly evolve. Further, science even when dealing
with material things emphasises the importance of mind.
The truthfulness of nature at any point in the physical
range is a truthfulness of the Overnature to the mind
of man, a correlation established between physical
and spiritual existence. Wherever order and care are
brought into view there is an exaltation of the human
reason which perceives and relates. All would be
thrown into confusion if the fidelity recognised by the
mind did not extend to the mind itself, if the sanity
and development of the mind were not included in the
order of the universe. For the psychological student
this is established, and the working of evolutionary law
is being traced in the obscure phenomena of consciousness,
sub-consciousness and habit.</p>

<p>Is it of importance that each of the gases shall have
laws of diffusion and combination, shall act according to
those laws, unvaryingly affecting vegetable and animal
life? Unless those laws wrought in constancy or
equity at every moment all would be confusion. Is it
of importance that the bird, using its wings, shall be able
to soar into the atmosphere; that the wings adapted
for flight shall find an atmosphere in which their
exercise produces movement? Here again is an equity
which enters into the very constitution of the cosmos,
which must be a form of the one supreme law of the
cosmos. Once more, is it of importance that the thinker
shall find sequences and relations, when once established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
a sound basis for prediction and discovery, that he
shall be able to trust himself on lines of research
and feel certain that, at every point, for the instrument
of inquiry there is answering verity? Without this
correspondence man would have no real place in
evolution, he would flutter an aimless unrelated sensitiveness
through a storm of physical incidents.</p>

<p>Advance to the most important facts of mind, the
moral ideas which enter into every department of
thought, the inductions through which we find our
place in another range than the physical. Does the
fidelity already traced now cease? Is man at this
point beyond the law of faithfulness, beyond the
invariable correlation of environment with faculty?
Does he now come to a region which he cannot choose
but enter, where, however, the cosmos fails him, the
beating wing cannot rise, the inquiring mind reaches
no verity, and the consciousness does flutter an
inexplicable thing through dreams and illusions? A
man has it in his nature to seek justice. Peace for
him there is none unless he does what is right and can
believe that right will be done. With this high conviction
in his mind he is opposed, as in this Book of
Job, by false men, overthrown by calamity, covered
with harsh judgment. Death approaches and he
has to pass away from a world that seems to have
failed him. Shall he never see his right nor God's
righteousness? Shall he never come to his own as a
man of good will and high resolve? Has he been true
to a cosmos which after all is treacherous, to a rule of
virtue which has no authority and no issue? He
believes in a Lord of infinite justice and truth; that his
life, small as it is, cannot be apart from the pervading
law of equity. Is that his dream? Then any moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the whole system of the universe may collapse like a
bubble blown upon a marsh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now let us clearly understand the point and value of
the argument. It is not that a man who has served
God here and suffered here must have a joyful
immortality. What man is faithful enough to make
such a claim? But the principle is that God must
vindicate His righteousness in dealing with the man
He has made, the man He has called to trust Him.
It matters not who the man is, how obscure his life has
been, he has this claim on God, that to him the eternal
righteousness ought to be made clear. Job cries for
his own justification; but the doubt about God involved
in the slur cast upon his own integrity is what rankles
in his heart; from that he rises in triumphant protest
and daring hope. He must live till God clears up the
matter. If he dies he must revive to have it all made
clear. And observe, if it were only that ignorant men
cast doubt on providence, the resurrection and personal
redemption of the believer would not be necessary.
God is not responsible for the foolish things men say,
and we could not look for resurrection because our
fellow-creatures misrepresent God. But Job feels that
God Himself has caused the perplexity. God sent
the flash of lightning, the storm, the dreadful disease;
it is God who by many strange things in human
experience seems to give cause for doubt. From God
in nature, God in disease, God in the earthquake and
the thunderstorm, God whose way is in the sea and
His path in the mighty waters&mdash;from this God, Job
cries in hope, in moral conviction, to God the Vindicator,
the eternally righteous One, Author of nature and
Friend of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>This life may terminate before the full revelation of
right is made; it may leave the good in darkness and
the evil flaunting in pride; the believer may go down
in shame and the atheist have the last word. Therefore
a future life with judgment in full must vindicate our
Creator; and every personality involved in the problems
of time must go forward to the opening of the
seals and the fulfilment of the things that are written
in the volumes of God. This evolution being for the
earlier stage and discipline of life, it works out nothing,
completes nothing. What it does is to furnish the
awaking spirit with material of thought, opportunity
for endeavour, the elements of life; with trial, temptation,
stimulus, and restraint. No one who lives to any
purpose or thinks with any sincerity can miss in the
course of his life one hour at least in which he shares
the tragical contest and adds the cry of his own soul to
that of Job, his own hope to that of ages that are
gone, straining to see the Goël who undertakes for
every servant of God.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1"><i>And afterward on the dust He will stand up;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And without my flesh I shall see Eloah.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By slow cycles of change the vast scheme of Divine providence
draws toward a glorious consummation. The
believer waits for it, seeing One who has gone before
him and will come after him, the Alpha and Omega of
all life. The fulness of time will at length arrive, the
time foreordained by God, foretold by Christ, when the
throne shall be set, the judgment shall be given, and
the æons of manifestation shall begin.</p>

<p>And who in that day shall be the sons of God?
Which of us can say that he knows himself worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
immortality? How imperfect is the noblest human
life, how often it falls away into the folly and evil of
the world! We need one to deliver us from the imperfection
that gives to all we are and do the character
of evanescence, to set us free from our entanglements
and bring us into liberty. We are poor erring
creatures. Only if there is a Divine purpose of grace
that extends to the unworthy and the frail, only if
there is redemption for the earthly, only if a Divine
Saviour has undertaken to justify our existence as
moral beings, can we look hopefully into the future.
Job looked for a Redeemer who would bring to light a
righteousness he claimed to possess. But our Redeemer
must be able to awaken in us the love of a righteousness
we alone could never see and to clothe us in a holiness
we could never of ourselves attain. The problem
of justice in human life will be solved because our
race has a Redeemer whose judgment when it falls will
fall in tenderest mercy, who bore our injustice for
our sakes and will vindicate for us that transcendent
righteousness which is for ever one with love.</p>

<p class="center"><i>IGNORANT CRITICISM OF LIFE.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Zophar speaks. Chap.</span> xx.</p>


<p>The great saying that quickens our faith and carries
thought into a higher world conveyed no Divine
meaning to the man from Naamah. The author must
have intended to pour scorn on the hide-bound intelligence
and rude bigotry of Zophar, to show him dwarfed
by self-content and zeal not according to knowledge.
When Job affirmed his sublime confidence in a Divine
Vindicator, Zophar caught only at the idea of an
avenger. What is this notion of a Goël on whose support
a condemned man dares to count, who shall do
judgment for him? And his resentment was increased
by the closing words of Job:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If ye say, How may we pursue him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And that the cause of the matter is in me&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then beware of the sword!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For hot are the punishments of the sword,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That ye may know there is judgment.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If they went on declaring that the root of the matter,
that is, the real cause of his affliction, was to be found
in his own bad life, let them beware the avenging
sword of Divine justice. He certainly implies that his
Goël may become their enemy if they continue to persecute
him with false charges. To Zophar the suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
is intolerable. With no little irritation and anger he
begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For this do my thoughts answer me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And by reason of this there is haste in me&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I hear the reproof which puts me to shame,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the spirit of my understanding gives me answer.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He speaks more hotly than in his first address,
because his pride is touched, and that prevents him
from distinguishing between a warning and a personal
threat. To a Zophar every man is blind who does
not see as he sees, and every word offensive that bids
him take pause. Believers of his kind have always
liked to appropriate the defence of truth, and they have
seldom done anything but harm. Conceive the dulness
and obstinacy of one who heard an inspired utterance
altogether new to human thought, and straightway
turned in resentment on the man from whom it came.
He is an example of the bigot in the presence of genius,
a little uncomfortable, a good deal affronted, very sure
that he knows the mind of God, and very determined
to have the last word. Such were the Scribes and
Pharisees of our Lord's time, most religious persons
and zealous for what they considered sound doctrine.
His light shone in darkness, and their darkness comprehended
it not; they did Him to death with an accusation
of impiety and blasphemy&mdash;"He made Himself
the Son of God," they said.</p>

<p>Zophar's whole speech is a fresh example of the
dogmatic hardness the writer was assailing, the closure
of the mind and the stiffening of thought. One might
not unjustly accuse this speaker of neglecting the moral
difference between the profane whose triumph and joy
he declares to be short, and the good man whose
career is full of years and honour. We may almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
say that to him outward success is the only mark of
inward grace, and that prosperous hypocrisy would be
mistaken by him for the most beautiful piety. His
whole creed about providence and retribution is such
that he is on the way to utter confusion of mind.
Why, he has said to himself that Job is a wicked and
false man&mdash;Job whose striking characteristic is outspoken
truthfulness, whose integrity is the pride of his
Divine Master. And if Zophar once accepts it as
indisputable that Job is neither good nor sincere, what
will the end be for himself? With more and more
assurance he will judge from a man's prosperity that he
is righteous, and from his afflictions that he is a reprobate.
He will twist and torture facts of life and modes
of thought, till the worship of property will become his
real cult, and to him the poor will of necessity seem
worthless. This is just what happened in Israel. It
is just what slovenly interpretation of the Bible and
providence has brought many to in our own time.
Side by side with a doctrine of self-sacrifice incredible
and mischievous, there is a doctrine of the earthly
reward of godliness&mdash;religion profitable for the life that
now is, in the way of filling the pockets and conducting
to eminent seats&mdash;an absurd and hurtful doctrine, for
ever being taught in one form if not another, and
applied all along the line of human life. An honest,
virtuous man, is he sure to find a good place in our
society? The rich broker or manufacturer, because
he washes, dresses, and has twenty servants to wait
upon him, is he therefore a fine soul? Nobody will
say so. Yet Christianity is so little understood in
some quarters, is so much associated with the error
of Zophar, that within the church a score are of his
opinion for one who is in Job's perplexity. Outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the proportion is much the same. The moral ideas
and philanthropies of our generation are perverted by
the notion that no one is succeeding as a man unless
he is making money and rising in the social scale. So,
independence of mind, freedom, integrity, and the
courage by which they are secured, are made of comparatively
little account.</p>

<p>It will be said that if things were rightly ordered,
Christian ideas prevailing in business, in legislation
and social intercourse, the best people would certainly
be in the highest places and have the best of life, and
that, meanwhile, the improvement of the world depends
on some approximation to this state of affairs. That is
to say, spiritual power and character must come into
visible union with the resources of the earth and
possession of its good things, otherwise there will be
no moral progress. Divine providence, we are told,
works after that manner; and the reasoning is plausible
enough to require close attention. There has always
been peril for religion in association with external
power and prestige&mdash;and the peril of religion is the
peril of progress. Will spiritual ideas ever urge those
whose lives they rule to seek with any solicitude the
gifts of time? Will they not, on the other hand,
increasingly, as they ought, draw the desires of the
best away from what is immediate, earthly, and in all
the lower senses personal? To put it in a word, must
not the man of spiritual mind always be a prophet, that
is, a critic of human life in its relations to the present
world? Will there come a time in the history of the
race when the criticism of the prophet shall no longer
be needed and his mantle will fall from him? That
can only be when all the Lord's people are prophets,
when everywhere the earthly is counted as nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
view of the heavenly, when men will seek continually a
new revelation of good, and the criticism of Christ shall
be so acknowledged that no one shall need to repeat
after Him, "How can ye believe which receive honour
one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh
from God only?" By heavenly means alone shall
heavenly ends be secured, and the keen pursuit of earthly
good will never bring the race of men into the paradise
where Christ reigns. Outward magnificence is neither
a symbol nor an ally of spiritual power. It hinders
instead of aiding the soul in the quest of what is
eternally excellent, touching the sensuous, not the
divine, in man. Christ is still, as in the days of His
flesh, utterly indifferent to the means by which power
and distinction are gained in the world. The spread
of His ideas, the manifestation of His Godhead, the
coming of His Kingdom, depend not the least on the
countenance of the great and the impression produced
on rude minds by the shows of wealth. The first task
of His gospel everywhere is to correct the barbaric
tastes of men; and the highest and best in a spiritual
age will be, as He was, thinkers, seers of truth, lovers
of God and man, lowly in heart and life. These will
express the penetrating criticism that shall move the
world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Zophar discourses of one who is openly unjust and
rapacious. He is candid enough to admit that, for a
time, the schemes and daring of the wicked may
succeed, but affirms that, though his head may "reach
to the clouds," it is only that he may be cast down.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Knowest thou not this from of old,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Since man was placed upon earth,</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That the triumphing of the wicked is short,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the joy of the godless but for a moment?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Though his excellency ascend to heaven,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And his head reach to the clouds,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They who saw him shall say, Where is he?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Like a dream he shall flee, no more to be found,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yea, he shall be chased away like a night-vision.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a certainty, based on facts quite evident since the
beginning of human history, Zophar presents anew
the overthrow of the evil-doer. He is sure that the
wicked does not keep his prosperity through a long
life. Such a thing has never occurred in the range of
human experience. The godless man is allowed, no
doubt, to lift himself up for a time; but his day is
short. Indeed he is great for a moment only, and that
in appearance. He never actually possesses the good
things of earth, but only seems to possess them. Then
in the hour of judgment he passes like a dream and
perishes for ever. The affirmation is precisely that
which has been made again and again; and with some
curiosity we scan the words of Zophar to learn what
addition he makes to the scheme so often pressed.</p>

<p>Sooth to say, there is no reasoning, nothing but
affirmation. He discusses no doubtful case, enters into
no careful discrimination of the virtuous who enjoy
from the godless who perish, makes no attempt to
explain the temporary success granted to the wicked.
The man he describes is one who has acquired wealth
by unlawful means, who conceals his wickedness,
rolling it like a sweet morsel under his tongue. We
are told further that he has oppressed and neglected
the poor and violently taken away a house, and he has
so behaved himself that all the miserable watch for his
downfall with hungry eyes. But these charges, virtually
of avarice, rapacity, and inhumanity, are far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
definite, far from categorical. Not without reason
would any man have so bad a reputation, and if deserved
it would ensure the combination against him
of all right-minded people. But men may be evil-hearted
and inhuman who are not rapacious; they
may be vile and yet not given to avarice. And
Zophar's account of the ruin of the profane, though he
makes it a Divine act, pictures the rising of society
against one whose conduct is no longer endurable&mdash;a
robber chief, the tyrant of a valley. His argument
fails in this, that though the history of the proud evil-doer's
destruction were perfectly true to fact, it would
apply to a very few only amongst the population,&mdash;one
in ten thousand,&mdash;leaving the justice of Divine providence
in greater doubt than ever, because the avarice
and selfishness of smaller men are not shown to have
corresponding punishment, are not indeed so much
as considered. Zophar describes one whose bold and
flagrant iniquity rouses the resentment of those not
particularly honest themselves, not religious, nor even
humane, but merely aware of their own danger from his
violent rapacity. A man, however, may be avaricious
who is not strong, may have the will to prey on others
but not the power. The real distinction, therefore, of
Zophar's criminal is his success in doing what many of
those he oppresses and despoils would do if they were
able, and the picturesque passage leaves no deep
moral impression. We read it and seem to feel that
the overthrow of this evil-doer is one of the rare and
happy instances of poetical justice which sometimes
occur in real life, but not so frequently as to make a
man draw back in the act of oppressing a poor dependant
or robbing a helpless widow.</p>

<p>In an sincerity Zophar speaks, with righteous indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
against the man whose ruin he paints, persuaded
that he is following, step for step, the march
of Divine judgment. His eye kindles, his voice rings
with poetic exultation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>He has succeeded for a time, concealing or fortifying
himself among the mountains. He has store of silver
and gold and garments taken by violence, of cattle and
sheep captured in the plain. But the district is roused.
Little by little he is driven back into the uninhabited
desert. His supplies are cut off and he is brought to
extremity. His food becomes to him as the gall of
asps. With all his ill-gotten wealth he is in straits,
for he is hunted from place to place. Not for him now
the luxury of the green oasis and the coolness of
flowing streams. He is an outlaw, in constant danger
of discovery. His children wander to places where
they are not known and beg for bread. Reduced
to abject fear, he restores the goods he had taken by
violence, trying to buy off the enmity of his pursuers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Then come the last skirmish, the clash of weapons,
ignominious death.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Vain is resistance when he is brought to bay by his
enemies. A moment of overwhelming terror, and he is
gone. His tent blazes up and is consumed, as if the
breath of God made hot the avenging flame. Within
it his wife and children perish. Heaven seems to have
called for his destruction and earth to have obeyed the
summons. So the craft and strength of the free-booter,
living on the flocks and harvests of industrious people,
are measured vainly against the indignation of God,
who has ordained the doom of wickedness.</p>

<p>A powerful word-picture. Yet if Zophar and the
rest taught such a doctrine of retribution, and, put to
it, could find no other; if they were in the way of
saying, "This is the lot of a wicked man from God,"
how far away must Divine judgment have seemed
from ordinary life, from the falsehoods daily spoken,
the hard words and blows dealt to the slave, the
jealousies and selfishnesses of the harem. Under the
pretext of showing the righteous Judge, Zophar makes
it impossible, or next to impossible, to realise His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
presence and authority. Men must be stirred up on
God's behalf or His judicial anger will not be felt.</p>

<p>It is however when we apply the picture to the case
of Job that we see its falsehood. Against the facts
of his career Zophar's account of Divine judgment
stands out as flat heresy, a foul slander charged on the
providence of God. For he means that Job wore in
his own settlement the hypocritical dress of piety and
benevolence and must have elsewhere made brigandage
his trade, that his servants who died by the sword of
Chaldæans and Sabeans and the fire of heaven had
been his army of rievers, that the cause of his ruin was
heaven's intolerance and earth's detestation of so vile a
life. Zophar describes poetic justice, and reasons back
from it to Job. Now it becomes flagrant injustice
against God and man. We cannot argue from what
sometimes is to what must be. Although Zophar had
taken in hand to convict one really and unmistakably
a miscreant, truth alone would have served the cause
of righteousness. But he assumes, conjectures, and
is immeasurably unjust and cruel to his friend.</p>

<p class="center"><i>ARE THE WAYS OF THE LORD EQUAL?</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chap.</span> xxi.</p>


<p>With less of personal distress and a more collected
mind than before Job begins a reply to
Zophar. His brave hope of vindication has fortified
his soul and is not without effect upon his bodily state.
The quietness of tone in this final address of the second
colloquy contrasts with his former agitation and the
growing eagerness of the friends to convict him of wrong.
True, he has still to speak of facts of human life troublous
and inscrutable. Where they lie he must look, and
terror seizes him, as if he moved on the edge of chaos.
It is, however, no longer his own controversy with God
that disquiets him. For the time he is able to leave
that to the day of revelation. But seeing a vaster
field in which righteousness must be revealed, he
compels himself, as it were, to face the difficulties which
are encountered in that survey. The friends have
throughout the colloquy presented in varying pictures
the offensiveness of the wicked man and his sure destruction.
Job, extending his view over the field they
have professed to search, sees the facts in another light.
While his statement is in the way of a direct negative
to Zophar's theory, he has to point out what seems
dreadful injustice in the providence of God. He is not
however, drawn anew into the tone of revolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>The opening words are as usual expostulatory, but
with a ring of vigour. Job sets the arguments of his
friends aside and the only demand he makes now is for
their attention.</p>

<span class="i1"><i>And why should I not be impatient?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What he has said hitherto has had little effect upon
them; what he is to say may have none. But he will
speak; and afterwards, if Zophar finds that he can
maintain his theory, why, he must keep to it and mock
on. At present the speaker is in the mood of disdaining
false judgment. He quite understands the conclusion
come to by the friends. They have succeeded
in wounding him time after time. But what presses
upon his mind is the state of the world as it really
is. Another impatience than of human falsehood urges
him to speak. He has returned upon the riddle of life
he gave Zophar to read&mdash;why the tents of robbers
prosper and they that provoke God are secure (chap.
xii. 6). Suppose the three let him alone for a while
and consider the question largely, in its whole scope.
They shall consider it, for, certainly, the robber chief
may be seen here and there in full swing of success,
with his children about him, gaily enjoying the fruit of
sin, and as fearless as if the Almighty were his special
protector. Here is something that needs clearing up.
Is it not enough to make a strong man shake?</p>

</div></div>

<p>Contrast the picture here with those which Bildad and
Zophar painted&mdash;and where lies the truth? Sufficiently
on Job's side to make one who is profoundly interested
in the question of Divine righteousness stand appalled.
There was an error of judgment inseparable from that
early stage of human education in which vigour and the
gains of vigour counted for more than goodness and the
gains of goodness, and this error clouding the thought
of Job made him tremble for his faith. Is nature
God's? Does God arrange the affairs of this world?
Why then, under His rule, can the godless have enjoyment,
and those who deride the Almighty feast on the
fat things of His earth? Job has sent into the future
a single penetrating look. He has seen the possibility
of vindication, but not the certainty of retribution. The
underworld into which the evil-doer descends in a
moment, without protracted misery, appears to Job no
hell of torment. It is a region of reduced, incomplete
existence, not of penalty. The very clearness with
which he saw vindication for himself, that is, for the
good man, makes it needful to see the wrong-doer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
judged and openly condemned. Where then shall this
be done? The writer, with all his genius, could only
throw one vivid gleam beyond the present. He could
not frame a new idea of Sheol, nor, passing its cloud
confines, reach the thought of personality continuing
in acute sensations either of joy or pain. The ungodly
ought to feel the heavy hand of Divine justice in the
present state of being. But he does not. Nature
makes room for him and his children, for their gay
dances and life-long hilarity. Heaven does not frown.
"The wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in
power; their houses are in peace, without fear."</p>

<p>From the climax of chap. xix. the speeches of Job
seem to fall away instead of advancing. The author
had one brilliant journey into the unseen, but the peak
he reached could not be made a new point of departure.
Knowledge he did not possess was now required.
He saw before him a pathless ocean where no man
had shown the way, and inspiration seems to have
failed him. His power lay in remarkably keen analysis
and criticism of known theological positions and in
glowing poetic sense. His inspiration working through
these persuaded him that everywhere God is the Holy
and True. It is scarcely to be supposed that condemnation
of the evil could have seemed to him of less
importance than vindication of the good. Our conclusion
therefore must be that a firm advance into the
other life was not for genius like his, nor for human
genius at its highest. One more than man must speak
of the great judgment and what lies beyond.</p>

<p>Clearly Job sees the unsolved enigma of the godless
man's prosperous life, states it, and stands trembling.
Regarding it what have other thinkers said? "If the
law of all creation were justice," says John Stuart Mill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
"and the Creator omnipotent, then in whatever amount
suffering and happiness might be dispensed to the
world, each person's share of them would be exactly
proportioned to that person's good or evil deeds; no
human being would have a worse lot than another
without worse deserts; accident or favouritism would
have no part in such a world, but every human life
would be the playing out of a drama constructed like
a perfect moral tale. No one is able to blind himself
to the fact that the world we live in is totally different
from this." Emerson, again, facing this problem,
repudiates the doctrine that judgment is not executed
in this world. He affirms that there is a fallacy in
the concession that the bad are successful, that justice
is not done now. "Every ingenuous and aspiring
soul," he says, "leaves the doctrine behind him in his
own experience; and all men feel sometimes the falsehood
which they cannot demonstrate." His theory
is that there is balance or compensation everywhere.
"Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which
the unwise seek to dodge, which one and another brags
that he does not know, that they do not touch him;&mdash;but
the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his
soul. If he escapes them in one part, they attack him
in another more vital part.... The ingenuity of man
has always been dedicated to the solution of one
problem,&mdash;how to detach the sensual sweet, the sensual
strong, the sensual bright, from the moral sweet, the
moral deep, the moral fair; that is, again, to contrive
to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as to leave it
bottomless; to get a <i>one end</i>, without an <i>other end</i>....
This dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted.
Pleasure is taken out of pleasant things, profit out of
profitable things, power out of strong things, so soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
we seek to separate them from the whole. We can no
more halve things and get the sensual good, by itself,
than we can get an inside that shall have no outside,
or a light without a shadow.... For everything you
have missed, you have gained something else, and for
everything you gain you lose something. If the
gatherer gathers too much, nature takes out of the man
what she puts into his chest; swells the estate but
kills the owner.... We feel defrauded of the retribution
due to evil acts, because the criminal adheres to
his vice and contumacy, and does not come to a crisis
or judgment anywhere in visible nature. There is no
stunning confutation of his nonsense before men and
angels. Has he therefore outwitted the law? Inasmuch
as he carries the malignity and the lie with him,
he so far deceases from nature. In some manner there
will be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding
also; but, should we not see it, this deadly
deduction makes square the account."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The argument
reaches far beneath that superficial condemnation of
the order of providence which disfigures Mr. Mill's
essay on Nature. So far as it goes, it illuminates the
present stage of human existence. The light, however,
is not sufficient, for we cannot consent to the theory
that in an ideal scheme, a perfect or eternal state, he
who would have holiness must sacrifice power, and he
who would be true must be content to be despised.
There is, we cannot doubt, a higher law; for this does
not in any sense apply to the life of God Himself. In
the discipline which prepares for liberty, there must be
restraints and limitations, gain&mdash;that is, development&mdash;by
renunciation; earthly ends must be subordinated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
spiritual; sacrifices must be made. But the present
state does not exhaust the possibilities of development
nor close the history of man. There is a kingdom
out of which shall be taken all things that offend. To
Emerson's compensations must be added the compensation
of Heaven. Still he lifts the problem out of the
deep darkness which troubled Job.</p>

<p>And with respect to the high position and success
bad men are allowed to enjoy, another writer, Bushnell,
well points out that permission of their opulence and
power by God aids the development of moral ideas.
"It is simply letting society and man be what they are,
to show what they are." The retributive stroke, swift
and visible, is not needed to declare this. "If one is
hard upon the poor, harsh to children, he makes, or
may, a very great discovery of himself. What is in
him is mirrored forth by his acts, and distinctly mirrored
in them.... If he is unjust, passionate, severe, revengeful,
jealous, dishonest, and supremely selfish, he
is in just that scale of society or social relationship
that brings him out to himself.... Evil is scarcely to
be known as evil till it takes the condition of authority.
We do not understand it till we see what kind of god
it will make, and by what sort of rule it will manage its
empire.... Just here all the merit of God's plan, as
regards the permission of power in the hands of wicked
men, will be found to hinge; namely, on the fact that
evil is not only revealed in its baleful presence and
agency, but the peoples and ages are put heaving
against it and struggling after deliverance from it."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It was, we say, Job's difficulty that against the new
conception of Divine righteousness which he sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the early idea stood opposed that life meant vigour
mainly in the earthly range. During a long period of
the world's history this belief was dominant, and virtue
signified the strength of man's arm, his courage in conflict,
rather than his truth in judgment and his purity
of heart. The outward gains corresponding to that
early virtue were the proof of the worth of life. And
even when the moral qualities began to be esteemed,
and a man was partly measured by the quality of his
soul, still the tests of outward success and the gains of
the inferior virtue continued to be applied to his life.
Hence the perturbation of Job and, to some extent, the
false judgment of providence quoted from a modern
writer.</p>

<p>But the chapter we are considering shows, if we
rightly interpret the obscure 16th verse, that the author
tried to get beyond the merely sensuous and earthly
reckoning. Those prospered who denied the authority
of God and put aside religion with the rudest scepticism.
There was no good in prayer, they said; it brought no
gain. The Almighty was nothing to them. Without
thought of His commands they sought their profit and
their pleasure, and found all they desired. Looking
steadfastly at their life, Job sees its hollowness, and
abruptly exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Ha! their good is not in their hand:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The counsel of the wicked be far from me!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Good! was that good which they grasped&mdash;their
abundance, their treasure? Were they to be called
blessed because their children danced to the lute and
the pipe and they enjoyed the best earth could provide?
The real good of life was not theirs. They had not
God; they had not the exultation of trusting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
serving Him; they had not the good conscience
towards God and man which is the crown of life. The
man lying in disease and shame would not exchange
his lot for theirs.</p>

<p>But Job must argue still against his friends' belief
that the wicked are visited with the judgment of the
Most High in the loss of their earthly possessions.
"The triumphing of the wicked is short," said Zophar,
"and the joy of the godless but for a moment." Is it
so?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That their calamity cometh upon them?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That God distributeth sorrows in His anger?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That they are as stubble before the wind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One in a thousand, Job may admit, has the light
extinguished in his tent and is swept out of the world.
But is it the rule or the exception that such visible
judgment falls even on the robber chief? The first
psalm has it that the wicked are "like the chaff which
the wind driveth away." The words of that chant may
have been in the mind of the author. If so, he disputes
the doctrine. And further he rejects with contempt
the idea that though a transgressor himself lives long
and enjoys to the end, his children after him may bear
his punishment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Let his own eyes see his destruction,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And let him drink of the wrath of Shaddai.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For what pleasure hath he in his house after him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When the number of his moons is cut off in the midst?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The righteousness Job is in quest of will not be
satisfied with visitation of the iniquities of the fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
upon the children. He will not accept the proverb
which Ezekiel afterwards repudiated, "The fathers
have eaten sour grapes, the children's teeth are set on
edge." He demands that the ways of God shall be
equal, that the soul that sinneth shall bear its punishment.
Is it anything to a wicked man that his
children are scattered and have to beg their bread
when he has passed away? A man grossly selfish
would not be vexed by the affliction of his family even
if, down in Sheol, he could know of it. What Zophar
has to prove is that every man who has lived a godless
life is made to drink the cup of Shaddai's indignation.
Though he trembles in sight of the truth, Job will press
it on those who argue falsely for God.</p>

<p>And with the sense of the inscrutable purposes of
the Most High burdening his soul he proceeds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Shall any teach God knowledge?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Seeing He judgeth those that are high?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Easy was it to insist that thus or thus Divine providence
ordained. But the order of things established
by God is not to be forced into harmony with a human
scheme of judgment. He who rules in the heights of
heaven knows how to deal with men on earth; and for
them to teach Him knowledge is at once arrogant and
absurd. The facts are evident, must be accepted and
reckoned with in all submission; especially must his
friends consider the fact of death, how death comes,
and they will then find themselves unable to declare
the law of the Divine government.</p>

<p>As yet, even to Job, though he has gazed beyond
death, its mystery is oppressive; and he is right in
urging that mystery upon his friends to convict them of
ignorance and presumption. Distinctions they affirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to lie between the good and the wicked are not made
by God in appointing the hour of death. One is called
away in his strong and lusty manhood; another lingers
till his becomes bitter and all the bodily functions are
impaired. "Alike they lie down in the dust and the
worms cover them." The thought is full of suggestion;
but Job presses on, returning for a moment to the false
charges against himself that he may bring a final
argument to bear on his accusers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold, I know your thoughts,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the devices ye wrongfully imagine against me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And, Where the tents in which the wicked dwelt?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Have ye not asked them that go by the way?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And do ye not regard their tokens&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That the wicked is spared in the day of destruction,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That they are led forth in the day of wrath?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So far from being overwhelmed in calamity the evil
doer is considered, saved as by an unseen hand.
Whose hand? My house is wasted, my habitations
are desolate, I am in extremity, ready to die. True:
but those who go up and down the land would teach
you to look for a different end to my career if I had
been the proud transgressor you wrongly assume me
to have been. I would have found a way of safety
when the storm-clouds gathered and the fire of heaven
burned. My prosperity would scarcely have been
interrupted. If I had been what you say, not one of
you would have dared to charge me with crimes against
men or impiety towards God. You would have been
trembling now before me. The power of an unscrupulous
man is not easily broken. He faces fate,
braves and overcomes the judgment of society.</p>

<p>And society accepts his estimate of himself, counts
him happy,&mdash;pays him honour at his death. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
scene at his funeral confutes the specious interpretation
of providence that has been so often used as a weapon
against Job. Perhaps Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar
know something of obsequies paid to a prosperous
tyrant, so powerful that they dared not deny him
homage even when he lay on his bier. Who shall
repay the evil-doer what he hath done?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Yea, he is borne to the grave,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And they keep watch over his tomb;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The clods of the valley are sweet to him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And all men draw after him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As without number they go before him.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is the gathering of a country-side, the tumultuous
procession, a vast disorderly crowd before the bier, a
multitude after it surging along to the place of tombs.
And there, in nature's greenest heart, where the clods
of the valley are sweet, they make his grave&mdash;and
there as over the dust of one of the honourable of
the earth they keep watch. Too true is the picture.
Power begets fear and fear enforces respect. With
tears and lamentations the Arabs went, with all the
trappings of formal grief moderns may be seen in
crowds following the corpse of one who had neither a
fine soul nor a good heart, nothing but money and
success to commend him to his fellow-men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the writer ends the second act of the drama, and
the controversy remains much where it was. The
meaning of calamity, the nature of the Divine government
of the world are not extracted. This only is
made clear, that the opinion maintained by the three
friends cannot stand. It is not true that joy and wealth
are the rewards of virtuous life. It is not always
the case that the evil-doer is overcome by temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
disaster. It is true that to good and bad alike death
is appointed, and together they lie down in the dust.
It is true that even then the good man's grave may be
forsaken in the desert, while the impious may have
a stately sepulchre. A new way is made for human
thought in the exposure of the old illusions and the
opening up of the facts of existence. Hebrew religion
has a fresh point of departure, a clearer view of the
nature and end of all things. The thought of the world
receives a spiritual germ; there is a making ready
for Him who said, "A man's life consisteth not in the
abundance of the things which he possesseth," and
"What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world,
and forfeit his life?" When we know what the earthly
cannot do for us we are prepared for the gospel of the
spiritual and for the living word.</p>

<p class="center"><i>DOGMATIC AND MORAL ERROR.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Eliphaz speaks. Chap.</span> xxii.</p>


<p>The second colloquy has practically exhausted the
subject of debate between Job and his friends.
The three have really nothing more to say in the way
of argument or awful example. It is only Eliphaz who
tries to clinch the matter by directly accusing Job of
base and cowardly offences. Bildad recites what may
be called a short ode, and Zophar, if he speaks at all,
simply repeats himself as one determined if possible to
have the last word.</p>

<p>And why this third round? While it has definite
marks of its own and the closing speeches of Job are
important as exhibiting his state of mind, another
motive seems to be required. And the following may
be suggested. A last indignity offered, last words of
hard judgment spoken, Job enters upon a long review
of his life, with the sense of being victorious in argument,
yet with sorrow rather than exultation because
his prayers are still unanswered; and during all this
time the appearance of the Almighty is deferred.
The impression of protracted delay deepens through
the two hundred and twenty sentences of the third
colloquy in which, one may say, all the resources of
poetry are exhausted. A tragic sense of the silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
God keeps is felt to hang over the drama, as it hangs
over human life. A man vainly strives to repel the
calumnies that almost break his heart. His accusers
advance from innuendo to insolence. He seeks in the
way of earnest thought escape from their false reasoning;
he appeals from men to God, from God in nature and
providence to God in supreme and glorious righteousness
behind the veil of sense and time. Unheard
apparently by the Almighty, he goes back upon his
life and rehearses the proofs of his purity, generosity,
and faith; but the shadow remains. It is the trial of
human patience and the evidence that neither a man's
judgment of his own life nor the judgment expressed
by other men can be final. God must decide, and for
His decision men must wait. The author has felt in
his own history this delay of heavenly judgment, and
he brings it out in his drama. He has also seen that
on this side death there can be no final reading of the
judgment of God on a human life. We wait for God;
He comes in a prophetic utterance which all must
reverently accept; yet the declaration is in general
terms. When at last the Almighty speaks from the
storm the righteous man and his accusers alike have
to acknowledge ignorance and error; there is an end
of self-defence and of condemnation by men, but no
absolute determination of the controversy. "The vision
is for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the
end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
because it will surely come, it will not delay. Behold,
his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him: but the
just shall live by his faith" (Hab. ii. 3, 4).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eliphaz begins with a singular question, which he is
moved to state by the whole tenor of Job's reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
and particularly by his hope that God would become
his Redeemer. "<i>Can a man be profitable unto God?</i>"
Not quite knowing what he asks, meaning simply to
check the boldness of Job's hope, he advances to the
brink of an abyss of doubt. You Job, he seems to
say, a mere mortal creature, afflicted enough surely
to know your own insignificance, how can you build
yourself up in the notion that God is interested in your
righteousness? You think God believes in you and
will justify you. How ignorant you must be if you
really suppose your goodness of any consequence to
the Almighty, if you imagine that by making your
ways perfect, that is, claiming an integrity which man
cannot possess, you will render any service to the
Most High. Man is too small a creature to be of any
advantage to God. Man's respect, faithfulness, and
devotion are essentially of no profit to Him.</p>

<p>One must say that Eliphaz opens a question of the
greatest interest both in theology or the knowledge of
God, and in religion or the right feelings of man toward
God. If man as the highest energy, the finest blossoming
and most articulate voice of the creation, is of no consequence
to his Creator, if it makes no difference to the
perfection or complacency of God in Himself whether
man serves the end of his being or not, whether man
does or fails to do the right he was made to love; if
it is for man's sake only that the way of life is provided
for him and the privilege of prayer given him,&mdash;then
our glorifying of God is not a reality but a mere form
of speech. The only conclusion possible would be that
even when we serve God earnestly in love and sacrifice
we are in point of fact serving ourselves. If one
wrestles with evil, clings to the truth, renounces all for
righteousness' sake, it is well for him. If he is hard-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and base, his life will decay and perish. But,
in either case, the eternal calm, the ineffable completeness
of the Divine nature are unaffected. Yea, though
all men and all intelligent beings were overwhelmed
in eternal ruin the Creator's glory would remain the
same, like a full-orbed sun shining over a desolate
universe.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">..."We are such stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dreams are made of, and our little life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is rounded by a sleep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eliphaz thinks it is for man's sake alone God has
created him, surrounded him with means of enjoyment
and progress, given him truth and religion, and laid
on him the responsibilities that dignify his existence.
But what comes then of the contention that, because
Job has sinned, desolation and disease have come to
him from the Almighty? If man's righteousness is of
no account to God, why should his transgressions be
punished? Creating men for their own sake, a beneficent
Maker would not lay upon them duties the neglect
of which through ignorance must needs work their ruin.
We know from the opening scenes of the book that the
Almighty took pleasure in His servant. We see Him
trying Job's fidelity for the vindication of His own
creative power and heavenly grace against the scepticism
of such as the Adversary. Is a faithful servant not
profitable to one whom he earnestly serves? Is it all
the same to God whether we receive His truth or reject
His covenant? Then the urgency of Christ's redemptive
work is a fiction. Satan is not only correct in
regard to Job but has stated the sole philosophy of
human life. We are to fear and serve God for what
we get; and our notions of doing bravely in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
warfare on behalf of God's kingdom are the fancies of
men who dream.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Can a man be profitable unto God?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or is it gain to Him that thou makest thy ways perfect?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is it for thy fear of Him that He reproveth thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That He entereth with thee into judgment?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Regarding this what are we to say? That it is false,
an ignorant attempt to exalt God at the expense of man,
to depreciate righteousness in the human range for the
sake of maintaining the perfection and self-sufficiency
of God. But the virtues of man, love, fidelity, truth,
purity, justice, are not his own. The power of them
in human life is a portion of the Divine energy, for they
are communicated and sustained by the Divine Spirit.
Were the righteousness, love, and faith instilled into
the human mind to fail of their result, were they,
instead of growing and yielding fruit, to decay and die,
it would be waste of Divine power; the moral cosmos
would be relapsing into a chaotic state. If we affirm
that the obedience and redemption of man do not profit
the Most High, then this world and the inhabitants of
it have been called into existence by the Creator in
grim jest, and He is simply amusing Himself with our
hazardous game.</p>

<p>With the same view of the absolute sovereignty of
God in creation and providence on which Eliphaz founds
in this passage, Jonathan Edwards sees the necessity
of escaping the conclusion to which these verses point.
He argues that God's delight in the emanations of His
fulness in the work of creation shows "His delight in
the infinite fulness of good there is in Himself and the
supreme respect and regard He has for Himself." An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
objector may say, he proceeds, "If it could be supposed
that God needed anything; or that the goodness of
His creatures could extend to Him; or that they could
be profitable to Him, it might be fit that God should
make Himself and His own interest His highest and
last end in creating the world. But seeing that God is
above all need and all capacity of being added to and
advanced, made better and happier in any respect; to
what purpose should God make Himself His end, or
seek to advance Himself in any respect by any of His
works?" The answer is&mdash;"God may delight with true
and great pleasure in beholding that beauty which is
an image and communication of His own beauty, an
expression and manifestation of His own loveliness.
And this is so far from being an instance of His
happiness not being in and from Himself, that it is an
evidence that He is happy in Himself, or delights and
has pleasure in His own beauty." Nor does this argue
any dependence of God on the creature for happiness.
"Though He has real pleasure in the creature's holiness
and happiness; yet this is not properly any pleasure
which He receives from the creature. For these
things are what He gives the creature."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Here to a
certain extent the reasoning is cogent and meets the
difficulty of Eliphaz; and at present it is not necessary
to enter into the other difficulty which has to be faced
when the Divine reprobation of sinful life needs
explanation. It is sufficient to say that this is a question
even more perplexing to those who hold with
Eliphaz than to those who take the other view. If man
for God's glory has been allowed a real part in the
service of eternal righteousness, his failure to do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
part of which he is capable, to which he is called, must
involve his condemnation. So far as his will enters
into the matter he is rightly held accountable, and must
suffer for neglect.</p>

<p>Passing to the next part of Eliphaz's address we find
it equally astray for another reason. He asks "<i>Is not
thy wickedness great?</i>" and proceeds to recount a list of
crimes which appear to have been charged against Job
in the base gossip of ill-doing people.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Is not thy wickedness great,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And no limit to thy iniquities?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And stripped the naked of their clothing.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou hast not given water to the weary,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thou hast withholden bread from the famished.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The man of might&mdash;his is the earth;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he that is in honour dwelt therein.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou hast sent widows away empty,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the arms of the orphans have been broken.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The worst here affirmed against Job is that he has
overborne the righteous claims of widows and orphans.
Bildad and Zophar made a mistake in alleging that
he had been a robber and a freebooter. Yet is
it less unfriendly to give ear to the cruel slanders
of those who in Job's day of prosperity had not
obtained from him all they desired and are now ready
with their complaints? No doubt the offences specified
are such as might have been committed by a man in
Job's position and excused as within his right. To
take a pledge for debt was no uncommon thing.
When water was scarce, to withhold it even from the
weary was no extraordinary baseness. Vambéry tells
us that on the steppes he has seen father and son
fighting almost to the death for the dregs of a skin of
water. Eliphaz, however, a good man, counts it no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
more than duty to share this necessary of life with any
fainting traveller, even if the wells are dry and the
skins are nearly empty. He also makes it a crime to
keep back corn in the year of famine. He says truly
that the man of might, doing such things, acts disgracefully.
But there was no proof that Job had been
guilty of this kind of inhumanity, and the gross perversion
of justice to which Eliphaz condescends recoils
on himself. It does not always happen so within our
knowledge. Pious slander gathered up and retailed
frequently succeeds. An Eliphaz endeavours to make
good his opinion by showing providence to be for
it; he keeps the ear open to any report that will
confirm what is already believed; and the circulating
of such a report may destroy the usefulness of a life,
the usefulness which is denied.</p>

<p>Take a broader view of the same controversy. Is
there no exaggeration in the charges thundered sometimes
against poor human nature? Is it not often
thought a pious duty to extort confession of sins men
never dreamed of committing, so that they may be
driven to a repentance that shakes life to its centre and
almost unhinges the reason? With conviction of error,
unbelief, and disobedience the new life must begin.
Yet religion is made unreal by the attempt to force on
the conscience and to extort from the lips an acknowledgment
of crimes which were never intended and are
perhaps far apart from the whole drift of the character.
The truthfulness of John the Baptist's preaching was
very marked. He did not deal with imaginary sins.
And when our Lord spoke of the duties and errors of
men either in discourse or parable, He never exaggerated.
The sins He condemned were all intelligible to
the reason of those addressed, such as the conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
was bound to own, must recognise as evil things, dishonouring
to the Almighty.</p>

<p>Having declared Job's imaginary crimes, Eliphaz
exclaims, "<i>Therefore snares are round about thee and
sudden fear troubleth thee</i>." With the whole weight of
assumed moral superiority he bears down upon the
sufferer. He takes upon him to interpret providence,
and every word is false. Job has clung to God as his
Friend. Eliphaz denies him the right, cuts him off as a
rebel from the grace of the King. Truly, it may be
said, religion is never in greater danger than when it is
upheld by hard and ignorant zeal like this.</p>

<p>Then, in the passage beginning at the twelfth verse,
the attempt is made to show Job how he had fallen
into the sins he is alleged to have committed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Is not God in the height of heaven?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And behold the cope of the stars how high they are!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thou saidst&mdash;What doth God know?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Can He judge through thick darkness?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thick clouds are a covering to Him that He seeth not;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He walketh on the round of heaven.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Job imagined that God whose dwelling-place is beyond
the clouds and the stars could not see what he did.
To accuse him thus is to pile offence upon injustice,
for the knowledge of God has been his continual
desire.</p>

<p>Finally, before Eliphaz ends the accusation, he
identifies Job's frame of mind with the proud indifference
of those whom the deluge swept away. Job
had talked of the prosperity and happiness of men who
had not God in all their thoughts. Was he forgetting
that dreadful calamity?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Wilt thou keep the old way</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Which wicked men have trodden?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who were snatched away before their time,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Whose foundation was poured out as a stream:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who said to God, Depart from us;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And what can the Almighty do unto us?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet He filled their houses with good things:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But the counsel of the wicked is far from me!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One who chose to go on in the way of transgressors
would share their fate; and in the day of his disaster
as of theirs the righteous should be glad and the
innocent break into scornful laughter.</p>

<p>So Eliphaz closes, finding it difficult to make out his
case, yet bound as he supposes to do his utmost for
religion by showing the law of the vengeance of God.
And, this done, he pleads and promises once more in
the finest passage that falls from his lips:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Acquaint now thyself with Him and be at peace:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thereby good shall come unto thee.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Receive, I pray thee, instruction from His mouth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And lay up His words in thy heart.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thou return to Shaddai, thou shalt be built up;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thou put iniquity far from thy tents:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And lay thy treasure in the dust,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And among the stones of the streams the gold of Ophir;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then shall Shaddai be thy treasure</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And silver in plenty unto thee.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At last there seems to be a strain of spirituality.
"Acquaint now thyself with God and be at peace."
Reconciliation by faith and obedience is the theme.
Eliphaz is ignorant of much; yet the greatness and
majesty of God, the supreme power which must be propitiated
occupy his thoughts, and he does what he can
to lead his friend out of the storm into a harbour of
safety. Though even in this strophe there mingles a
taint of sinister reflection, it is yet far in advance of
anything Job has received in the way of consolation.
Admirable in itself is the picture of the restoration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a reconciled life from which unrighteousness is put far
away. He seems indeed to have learned something at
last from Job. Now he speaks of one who in his desire
for the favour and friendship of the Most High sacrifices
earthly treasure, flings away silver and gold as worthless.
No doubt it is ill-gotten wealth to which he refers,
treasure that has a curse upon it. Nevertheless one is
happy to find him separating so clearly between earthly
riches and heavenly treasure, advising the sacrifice of
the lower for what is infinitely higher. There is even
yet hope of Eliphaz, that he may come to have a spiritual
vision of the favour and friendship of the Almighty.
In all he says here by way of promise there is not a
word of renewed temporal prosperity. Returning to
Shaddai in obedience Job will pray and have his prayer
answered. Vows he has made in the time of trouble
shall be redeemed, for the desired aid shall come.
Beyond this there shall be, in the daily life, a strength,
decision, and freedom previously unknown. "<i>Thou
shalt decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee.</i>"
The man who is at length in the right way of life, with
God for his ally, shall form his plans and be able to
carry them out.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>When they cast down, thou shalt say, Uplifting!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the humble person He shall save.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He will deliver the man not innocent;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yea he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thine hands.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>True, in the future experience of Job there may be
disappointment and trouble. Eliphaz cannot but see
that the ill-will of the rabble may continue long, and
perhaps he is doubtful of the temper of his own friends.
But God will help His servant who returns to humble
obedience. And having been himself tried Job will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
intercede for those in distress, perhaps on account of
their sin, and his intercession will prevail with God.</p>

<p>Put aside the thought that all this is said to Job, and
it is surely a counsel of wisdom. To the proud and
self-righteous it shows the way of renewal. Away with
the treasures, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, that
keep the soul from its salvation. Let the Divine love
be precious to thee and the Divine statutes thy joy.
Power to deal with life, to overcome difficulties, to serve
thy generation shall then be thine. Standing securely
in God's grace thou shalt help the weary and heavy
laden. Yet Eliphaz cannot give the secret of spiritual
peace. He does not really know the trouble at the
heart of human life. We need for our Guide One who
has borne the burden of a sorrow which had nothing to
do with the loss of worldly treasure but with the unrest
perpetually gnawing at the heart of humanity, who
"bore our sin in His own body unto the tree" and
led captivity captive. What the old world could not
know is made clear to eyes that have seen the cross
against the falling night and a risen Christ in the fresh
Easter morning.</p>

<p class="center"><i>WHERE IS ELOAH?</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chaps.</span> xxiii., xxiv.</p>


<p>The obscure couplet with which Job begins appears
to involve some reference to his whole condition
alike of body and mind.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Again, to-day, my plaint, my rebellion!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The hand upon me is heavier than my groanings.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I must speak of my trouble and you will count it
rebellion. Yet, if I moan and sigh, my pain and weariness
are more than excuse. The crisis of faith is with
him, a protracted misery, and hope hangs trembling in
the balance. The false accusations of Eliphaz are in
his mind; but they provoke only a feeling of weary discontent.
What men say does not trouble him much.
He is troubled because of that which God refuses to do
or say. Many indeed are the afflictions of the righteous.
But every case like his own obscures the providence of
God. Job does not entirely deny the contention of his
friends that unless suffering comes as a punishment
of sin there is no reason for it. Hence, even though
he maintains with strong conviction that the good are
often poor and afflicted while the wicked prosper, yet
he does not thereby clear up the matter. He must
admit to himself that he is condemned by the events of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
life. And against the testimony of outward circumstance
he makes appeal in the audience chamber of
the King.</p>

<p>Has the Most High forgotten to be righteous for a
time? When the generous and true are brought into
sore straits, is the great Friend of truth neglecting His
task as Governor of the world? That would indeed
plunge life into profound darkness. And it seems to
be even so. Job seeks deliverance from this mystery
which has emerged in his own experience. He would
lay his cause before Him who alone can explain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Oh that I knew where I might find Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That I might come even to His seat!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I would order my cause before Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And fill my mouth with arguments.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I would know the words which He would answer me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And understand what He would say unto me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Present to Job's mind here is the thought that he is
under condemnation, and along with this the conviction
that his trial is not over. It is natural that his
mind should hover between these ideas, holding strongly
to the hope that judgment, if already passed, will be
revised when the facts are fully known.</p>

<p>Now this course of thought is altogether in the
darkness. But what are the principles unknown to
Job, through ignorance of which he has to languish in
doubt? Partly, as we long ago saw, the explanation
lies in the use of trial and affliction as the means of
deepening spiritual life. They give gravity and therewith
the possibility of power to our existence. Even
yet Job has not realised that one always kept in the
primrose path, untouched by the keen air of "misfortune,"
although he had, to begin, a pious disposition
and a blameless record, would be worth little in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
end to God or to mankind. And the necessity for the
discipline of affliction and disappointment, even as it
explains the smaller troubles, explains also the greatest.
Let ill be heaped on ill, disaster on disaster, disease on
bereavement, misery on sorrow, while stage by stage
the life goes down into deeper circles of gloom and
pain, it may acquire, it will acquire, if faith and faithfulness
towards God remain, massiveness, strength and
dignity for the highest spiritual service.</p>

<p>But there is another principle, not yet considered,
which enters into the problem and still more lightens
up the valley of experience which to Job appeared so
dark. The poem touches the fringe of this principle
again and again, but never states it. The author saw
that men were born to trouble. He made Job suffer
more because he had his integrity to maintain than if
he had been guilty of transgressions by acknowledging
which he might have pacified his friends. The burden
lay heavily upon Job because he was a conscientious man,
a true man, and could not accept any make-believe in
religion. But just where another step would have carried
him into the light of blessed acquiescence in the will of
God, the power failed, he could not advance. Perhaps
the genuineness and simplicity of his character would
have been impaired if he had thought of it, and we
like him better because he did not. The truth, however,
is that Job was suffering for others, that he was,
by the grace of God, a martyr, and so far forth in the
spirit and position of that suffering Servant of Jehovah
of whom we read in the prophecies of Isaiah.</p>

<p>The righteous sufferers, the martyrs, what are they?
Always the vanguard of humanity. Where they go and
the prints of their bleeding feet are left, there is the way
of improvement, of civilisation, of religion. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
successful man, preacher or journalist or statesman, is
popularly supposed to be leading the world in the
right path. Where the crowd goes shouting after him,
is that not the way of advance? Do not believe it.
Look for a teacher, a journalist, a statesman who is not
so successful as he might be, because he will, at all
hazards, be true. The Christian world does not yet
know the best in life, thought and morality for the
best. He who sacrifices position and esteem to righteousness,
he who will not bow down to the great idol
at the sound of sackbut and psaltery, observe where
that man is going, try to understand what he has in
his mind. Those who under defeat or neglect remain
steadfast in faith have the secrets we need to know.
To the ranks even of the afflicted and broken the author
of Job turned for an example of witness-bearing to
high ideas and the faith in God which brings salvation.
But he wrought in the shadow, and his hero is unconscious
of his high calling. Had Job seen the principles
of Divine providence which made him a helper of
human faith, we should not now hear him cry for an
opportunity of pleading his cause before God.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Would He contend with me in His mighty power?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nay, but He would give heed to me.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>So should I get free for ever from my Judge.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is in a sense startling to hear this confident expectation
of acquittal at the bar of God. The common
notion is that the only part possible to man in his natural
state is to fear the judgment to come and dread the
hour that shall bring him to the Divine tribunal.
From the ordinary point of view the language of Job
here is dangerous, if not profane. He longs to meet
the Judge; he believes that he could so state his case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
that the Judge would listen and be convinced. The
Almighty would not contend with him any longer as
his powerful antagonist, but would pronounce him
innocent and set him at liberty for ever. Can mortal
man vindicate himself before the bar of the Most High?
Is not every one condemned by the law of nature and
of conscience, much more by Him who knoweth all
things? And yet this man who believes he would be
acquitted by the great King has already been declared
"perfect and upright, one that feareth God and escheweth
evil." Take the declaration of the Almighty Himself
in the opening scenes of the book, and Job is found
what he claims to be. Under the influence of that
Divine grace which the sincere and upright may enjoy
he has been a faithful servant and has earned the approbation
of his Judge. It is by faith he is made righteous.
Religion and love of the Divine law have been his
guides; he has followed them; and what one has done
may not others do? Our book is concerned not so
much with the corruption of human nature, as with the
vindication of the grace of God given to human nature.
Corrupt and vile as humanity often is, imperfect and
spiritually ignorant as it always is, the writer of this
book is not engaged with that view. He directs attention
to the virtuous and honourable elements and shows
God's new creation in which He may take delight.</p>

<p>We shall indeed find that after the Almighty has
spoken out of the storm, Job says, "I repudiate my
words and repent in dust and ashes." So he appears
to come at last to the confession which, from one point
of view, he ought to have made at the first. But those
words of penitence imply no acknowledgment of iniquity
after all. They are confession of ignorant judgment.
Job admits with sorrow that he has ventured too far in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
his attempt to understand the ways of the Almighty,
that he has spoken without knowledge of the universal
providence he had vainly sought to fathom.</p>

<p>The author's intention plainly is to justify Job in his
desire for the opportunity of pleading his cause, that
is, to justify the claim of the human reason to comprehend.
It is not an offence to him that much of the
Divine working is profoundly difficult to interpret. He
acknowledges in humility that God is greater than man,
that there are secrets with the Almighty which the
human mind cannot penetrate. But so far as suffering
and sorrow are appointed to a man and enter into his
life, he is considered to have the right of inquiry regarding
them, an inherent claim on God to explain them.
This may be held the error of the author which he
himself has to confess when he comes to the Divine
interlocution. There he seems to allow the majesty of
the Omnipotent to silence the questions of human reason.
But this is really a confession that his own knowledge
does not suffice, that he shares the ignorance of Job
as well as his cry for light. The universe is vaster
than he or any of the Old Testament age could even
imagine. The destinies of man form part of a Divine
order extending through the immeasurable spaces and
the developments of eternal ages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more Job perceives or seems to perceive that
access to the presence of the Judge is denied. The
sense of condemnation shuts him in like prison walls
and he finds no way to the audience chamber. The
bright sun moves calmly from east to west; the
gleaming stars, the cold moon in their turn glide silently
over the vault of heaven. Is not God on high? Yet
man sees no form, hears no sound.</p>

<span class="i0">"Speak to Him thou, for He hears, and spirit with spirit can meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Job is not able to conceive a spiritual presence
without shape or voice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold, I go forward, but He is not there;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And backward, but I cannot perceive Him:</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Nature, thou hast taught this man by thy light and
thy darkness, thy glorious sun and thy storms, the
clear-shining after rain, the sprouting corn and the
clusters of the vine, by the power of man's will and
the daring love and justice of man's heart. In all
thou hast been a revealer. But thou hidest whom
thou dost reveal. To cover in thought the multiplicity
of thy energies in earth and sky and sea, in
fowl and brute and man, in storm and sunshine, in
reason, in imagination, in will and love and hope;&mdash;to
attach these one by one to the idea of a Being
almighty, infinite, eternal, and so to <i>conceive</i> this
God of the universe&mdash;it is, we may say, a superhuman
task. Job breaks down in the effort to realise
the great God. I look behind me, into the past.
There are the footprints of Eloah when He passed
by. In the silence an echo of His step may be heard;
but God is not there. On the right hand, away beyond
the hills that shut in the horizon, on the left hand
where the way leads to Damascus and the distant
north&mdash;not there can I see His form; nor out yonder
where day breaks in the east. And when I travel
forward in imagination, I who said that my Redeemer
shall stand upon the earth, when I strive to conceive
His form, still, in utter human incapacity, I fail.
"Verily, Thou art a God that hidest Thyself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, Job's conviction of his own uprightness, is
it not God's witness to his spirit? Can he not be
content with that? To have such a testimony is to
have the very verdict he desires. Well does Boethius,
a writer of the old world though he belonged to the
Christian age, press beyond Job where he writes: "He
is always Almighty, because He always wills good and
never any evil. He is always equally gracious. By
His Divine power He is everywhere present. The
Eternal and Almighty always sits on the throne of His
power. Thence He is able to see all, and renders to
every one with justice, according to his works. Therefore
it is not in vain that we have hope in God; for
He changes not as we do. But pray ye to Him
humbly, for He is very bountiful and very merciful.
Hate and fly from evil as ye best may. Love virtues
and follow them. Ye have great need that ye always
do well, for ye always in the presence of the Eternal
and Almighty God do all that ye do. He beholds it
all, and He will recompense it all."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Amiel, on the other hand, would fain apply to Job
a reflection which has occurred to himself in one of
the moods that come to a man disappointed, impatient
of his own limitations. In his journal, under date
January 29th, 1866, he writes: "It is but our secret
self-love which is set upon this favour from on high;
such may be our desire, but such is not the will of
God. We are to be exercised, humbled, tried and
tormented to the end. It is our patience which is the
touchstone of our virtue. To bear with life even when
illusion and hope are gone; to accept this position of
perpetual war, while at the same time loving only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
peace; to stay patiently in the world, even when it
repels us as a place of low company and seems to us
a mere arena of bad passions; to remain faithful to
one's own faith without breaking with the followers
of false gods; to make no attempt to escape from the
human hospital, long-suffering and patient as Job upon
his dunghill;&mdash;this is duty."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> An evil mood prompts
Amiel to write thus. A thousand times rather would
one hear him crying like Job on the great Judge and
Redeemer and complaining that the Goël hides Himself.
It is not in bare self-love or self-pity Job seeks acquittal
at the bar of God; but in the defence of conscience,
the spiritual treasure of mankind and our very life.
No doubt his own personal justification bulks largely
with Job, for he has strong individuality. He will
not be overborne. He stands at bay against his three
friends and the unseen adversary. But he loves integrity,
the virtue, first; and for himself he cares as
the representative of that which the Spirit of God gives
to faithful men. He may cry, therefore, he may defend
himself, he may complain; and God will not cast him
off.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For He knoweth the way that I take;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If He tried me, I should come forth as gold.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>His way have I kept, and not turned aside.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my needful food.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bravely, not in mere vaunt he speaks, and it is good
to hear him still able to make such a claim. Why do
we not also hold fast to the garment of our Divine
Friend? Why do we not realise and exhibit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
resolute godliness that anticipates judgment: "If He
tried me, I should come forth as gold"? The psalmists
of Israel stood thus on their faith; and not in vain,
surely, has Christ called us to be like our Father who
is in heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But again from brave affirmation Job falls back
exhausted.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>So, as Bailey makes his Festus speak, might Job
have spoken here. For now it seems to him that to
call on God is fruitless. Eloah is of one mind. His
will is steadfast, immovable. Death is in the cup and
death will come. On this God has determined. Nor
is it in Job's case alone so sore a doom is performed by
the Almighty. Many such things are with Him. The
waves of trouble roll up from the deep dark sea and go
over the head of the sufferer. He lies faint and desolate
once more. The light fades, and with a deep sigh
because he ever came to life he shuts his lips.</p>

<p>Natural religion ends always with a sigh. The sense
of God found in the order of the universe, the dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
vision of God which comes in conscience, moral life
and duty, in fear and hope and love, in the longing for
justice and truth&mdash;these avail much; but they leave
us at the end desiring something they cannot give.
The Unknown God whom men ignorantly worshipped
had to be revealed by the life and truth and power of
the Man Christ Jesus. Not without this revelation,
which is above and beyond nature, can our eager quest
end in satisfying knowledge. In Christ alone the
righteousness that justifies, the love that compassionates,
the wisdom that enlightens are brought into the
range of our experience and communicated through
reason to faith.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In chap. xxiv. there is a development of the reasoning
contained in Job's reply to Zophar in the second colloquy,
and there is also a closer examination of the nature and
results of evil-doing than has yet been attempted. In
the course of his acute and careful discrimination Job
allows something to his friends' side of the argument,
but all the more emphasises the series of vivid touches
by which the prosperous tyrant is represented. He
modifies to some extent his opinion previously expressed
that all goes well with the wicked. He finds that
certain classes of miscreants do come to confusion, and
he separates these from the others, at the same time
separating himself beyond question from the oppressor
on this side and the murderer and adulterer on that.
Accepting the limits of discussion chosen by the friends
he exhausts the matter between himself and them. By
the distinctions now made and the choice offered, Job
arrests personal accusation, and of that we hear no
more.</p>

<p>Continuing the idea of a Divine assize which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
governed his thought throughout this reply, Job asks
why it should not be held openly from time to time in
the world's history.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Why are times not set by the Almighty?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And why do not they who know Him see His days?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Emerson says the world is full of judgment-days; Job
thinks it is not, but ought to be. Passing from his own
desire to have access to the bar of God and plead there,
he now thinks of an open court, a public vindication
of God's rule. The Great Assize is never proclaimed.
Ages go by; the Righteous One never appears. All
things continue as they were from the beginning of the
creation. Men struggling, sinning, suffering, doubt or
deny the existence of a moral Ruler. They ask, Who
ever saw this God? If He exists, He is so separate
from the world by His own choice that there is no need
to consider Him. In pride or in sorrow men raise the
question. But <i>no God</i> means no justice, no truth, no
penetration of the real by the ideal; and thought cannot
rest there.</p>

<p>With great vigour and large knowledge of the world
the writer makes Job point out the facts of human
violence and crime, of human condonation and punishment.
Look at the oppressors and those who cringe
under them, the despots never brought to justice, but
on the contrary growing in power through the fear
and misery of their serfs. Already we have seen how
perilous it is to speak falsely for God. Now we see,
on the other hand, that whoever speaks truly of the
facts of human experience prepares the way for a true
knowledge of God. Those who have been looking in
vain for indications of Divine justice and grace are to
learn that not in deliverance from the poverty and
trouble of this world but in some other way they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
realise God's redemption. The writer of the book is
seeking after that kingdom which is not meat and drink
nor long life and happiness, but righteousness and
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Observe first, says Job, the base and cruel men who
remove landmarks and claim as their own a neighbour's
heritage, who drive into their pastures flocks that are
not theirs, who even take away the one ass of the
fatherless and the one ox the widow has for ploughing
her scanty fields, who thus with a high hand overbear
all the defenceless people within their reach. Zophar
had charged Job with similar crimes, and no direct reply
was given to the accusation. Now, speaking strongly
of the iniquity of such deeds, Job makes his accusers
feel their injustice towards him. There are men who
do such things. I have seen them, wondered at them,
been amazed that they were not struck down by the
hand of God. My distress is that I cannot understand
how to reconcile their immunity from punishment with
my faith in Him whom I have served and trusted as
my Friend.</p>

<p>The next picture, from the fifth to the eighth verse,
shows in contrast to the tyrant's pride and cruelty the
lot of those who suffer at his hands. Deprived of their
land and their flocks, herding together in common
danger and misery like wild asses, they have to seek
for their food such roots and wild fruits as can be found
here and there in the wilderness. Half enslaved now
by the man who took away their land they are driven
to the task of harvesting his fodder and gathering the
gleanings of his grapes. Naked they lie in the field,
huddling together for warmth, and out among the hills
they are wet with the impetuous rains, crouching in
vain under the ledges of the rock for shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Worse things too are done, greater sufferings than
these have to be endured. Men there are who pluck
the fatherless child from the mother's breast, claiming
the poor little life as a pledge. Miserable debtors, faint
with hunger, have to carry the oppressor's sheaves of
corn. They have to grind at the oil-presses, and with
never a cluster to slake their thirst tread the grapes in
the hot sun. Nor is it only in the country cruelties are
practised. Perhaps in Egypt the writer has seen what
he makes Job describe, the misery of city life. In the
city the dying groan uncared for, and the soul of the
wounded crieth out. Universal are the scenes of social
iniquity. The world is full of injustice. And to Job
the sting of it all is that "<i>God regardeth not the wrong.</i>"</p>

<p>Men talk nowadays as if the penury and distress
prevalent in our large towns proved the churches to be
unworthy of their name and place. It may be so. If
this can be proved, let it be proved; and if the institution
called The Church cannot justify its existence and
its Christianity where it should do so by freeing the
poor from oppression and securing their rights to the
weak, then let it go to the wall. But here is Job carrying
the accusation a stage farther, carrying it, with
what may appear blasphemous audacity, to the throne
of God. He has no church to blame, for there is no
church. Or, he himself represents what church there
is. And as a witness for God, what does he find to be
his portion? Behold him, where many a servant of
Divine righteousness has been in past times and is now,
down in the depths, poorest of the poor, bereaved,
diseased, scorned, misunderstood, hopeless. Why is
there suffering? Why are there many in our cities
outcasts of society, such as society is? Job's case is
a partial explanation; and here the church is not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
blame. Pariahs of society, we say. If society consists
to any great extent of oppressors who are enjoying
wealth unjustly gained, one is not so sure that there is
any need to pity those who are excluded from society.
Am I trying to make out that it may be well there are
oppressors, because oppression is not the worst thing
for a brave soul? No: I am only using the logic of
the Book of Job in justifying Divine providence. The
church is criticised and by many in these days condemned
as worthless because it is not banishing
poverty. Perhaps it might be more in the way of
duty and more likely to succeed if it sought to banish
excessive wealth. Are we of the twentieth Christian
century to hold still by the error of Eliphaz and the
rest of Job's friends? Are we to imagine that those
whom the gospel blesses it must of necessity enrich,
so that in their turn they may be tempted to act the
Pharisee? Let us be sure God knows how to govern
His world. Let us not doubt His justice because many
are very poor who have been guilty of no crimes and
many very rich who have been distinguished by no
virtues. It is our mistake to think that all would be
well if no bitter cries were heard in the midnight streets
and every one were secured against penury. While
the church is partly to blame for the state of things, the
salvation of society will not be found in any earthly
socialism. On that side lies a slough as deep as the
other from which it professes to save. The large
Divine justice and humanity which the world needs are
those which Christ alone has taught, Christ to whom
property was only something to deal with on the way
to spiritual good,&mdash;humility, holiness, love and faith.</p>

<p>The emphatic "<i>These</i>" with which verse 13 begins
must be taken as referring to the murderer and adulterer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
immediately to be described. Quite distinct from the
strong oppressors who maintain themselves in high position
are these cowardly miscreants who "rebel against
the light" (ver. 13), who "in the dark dig through houses"
and "know not the light" (ver. 16), to whom "the morning
is as the shadow of death," whose "portion is cursed in
the earth." The passage contains Job's admission that
there are vile transgressors of human and Divine law
whose unrighteousness is broken as a tree (ver. 20).
Without giving up his main contention as to high-handed
wickedness prospering in the world he can
admit this; nay, asserting it he strengthens his position
against the arguments of his friends. The murderer
who rising towards daybreak waylays and kills the
poor and needy for the sake of their scanty belongings,
the adulterer who waits for the twilight, disguising his
face, and the thief who in the dark digs through the
clay wall of a house&mdash;these do find the punishment of
their treacherous and disgusting crimes in this life.
The coward who is guilty of such sin is loathed even
by the mother who bore him and has to skulk in by-ways,
familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death,
daring not to turn in the way of the vineyards to enjoy
their fruit. The description of these reprobates ends
with the twenty-first verse, and then there is a return
to the "mighty" and the Divine support they appear
to enjoy.</p>

<p>The interpretation of verses 18-21 which makes
them "either actually in part the work of a popular
hand, or a parody after the popular manner by Job
himself," has no sufficient ground. To affirm that
the passage is introduced ironically and that verse 22
resumes the real history of the murderer, the adulterer,
and the thief is to neglect the distinction between those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
"who rebel against the light" and the mighty who
live in the eye of God. The natural interpretation is
that which makes the whole a serious argument against
the creed of the friends. In their eagerness to convict
Job they have failed to distinguish between men whose
base crimes bring them under social reprobation and
the proud oppressors who prosper through very arrogance.
Regarding these the fact still holds that
apparently they are under the protection of Heaven.</p>

<p>Is the daring right-defying evil-doer wasted by disease,
preyed upon by terror? Not so. When he
appears to have been crushed, suddenly he starts up
again in new vigour, and when he dies, it is not
prematurely but in the ripeness of full age. With this
reaffirmation of the mystery of God's dealings Job
challenges his friends. They have his final judgment.
The victory he gains is that of one who will be true at
all hazards. Perhaps in the background of his thought
is the vision of a redemption not only of his own life
but of all those broken by the injustice and cruelty of
this earth.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE DOMINION AND THE BRIGHTNESS.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Bildad speaks. Chap.</span> XXV.</p>


<p>The argument of the last chapter proceeded entirely
on the general aspect of the question whether the
evil are punished in proportion to their crimes. Job
has met his friends so far as to place them in a great
difficulty. They cannot assail him now as a sort of
infidel. And yet what he has granted does not yield
the main ground. They cannot deny his contrast between
the two classes of evil-doers nor refuse to admit
that the strong oppressor has a different fate from the
mean adulterer or thief. Bildad therefore confines
himself to two general principles, that God is the
supreme administrator of justice and that no man is
clean. He will not now affirm that Job has been a
tyrant to the poor. He dares not call him a murderer
or a housebreaker. A snare has been laid for him
who spoke much of snares, and seeing it he is on his
guard.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Dominion and fear are with Him;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He maketh peace in His high places</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>And the son of man, the worm!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The brief ode has a certain dignity raising it above
the level of Bildad's previous utterances. He desires
to show that Job has been too bold in his criticism of
providence. God has sole dominion and claims universal
adoration. Where He dwells in the lofty place
of unapproachable glory His presence and rule create
peace. He is the Lord of innumerable armies (the
stars and their inhabitants perhaps), and His light fills
the breadth of interminable space, revealing and illuminating
every life. Upon this assertion of the majesty
of God is based the idea of His holiness. Before so
great and glorious a Being how can man be righteous?
The universality of His power and the brightness of
his presence stand in contrast to the narrow range
of human energy and the darkness of the human mind.
Behold, says Bildad, the moon is eclipsed by a glance
of the great Creator and the stars are cast into shadow
by His effulgence; and how shall man whose body is
of the earth earthy claim any cleanness of soul? He
is like the worm; his kinship is with corruption; his
place is in the dust like the creeping things of which
he becomes the prey.</p>

<p>The representation of God in His exaltation and
gory has a tone of impressive piety which redeems
Bildad from any suspicion of insolence at this point.
He is including himself and his friends among those
whose lives appear impure in the sight of Heaven. He
is showing that successfully as Job may repel the
charges brought against him, there is at all events one
general condemnation in which with all men he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
allow himself to be involved. Is he not a feeble
ignorant man whose will being finite must be imperfect?
On the one hand is the pious exaltation of God, on the
other the pious abasement of man.</p>

<p>It is, however, easy to see that Bildad is still bound
to a creed of the superficial kind without moral depth
or spiritual force. The ideas are those of a nature
religion in which the one God is a supreme Baal or
Master, monopolising all splendour, His purity that of
the fire or the light. We are shown the Lord of the
visible universe whose dwelling is in the high heavens,
whose representative is the bright sun from the light
of which nothing is hidden. It is easy to point to this
splendid apparition and, contrasting man with the great
fire-force, the perennial fountain of light, to say&mdash;How
dark, how puny, how imperfect is man. The brilliance
of an Arabian sky through which the sun marches in
unobstructed glory seems in complete contrast to the
darkness of human life. Yet, is it fair, is it competent
to argue thus? Is anything established as to the
moral quality of man because he cannot shine like the
sun or even with the lesser light of moon or stars?
One may allow a hint of strong thought in the suggestion
that boundless majesty and power are necessary to
perfect virtue, that the Almighty alone can be entirely
pure. But Bildad cannot be said to grasp this idea.
If it gleams before his mind, the faint flash passes
unrecognised. He has not wisdom enough to work
out such a thought. And it is nature that according
to his argument really condemns man. Job is bidden
look up to the sun and moon and stars and know
himself immeasurably less pure than they.</p>

<p>But the truth stands untouched that man whose
body is doomed to corruption, man who labours after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the right, with the heat of moral energy in his heart,
moves on a far higher plane as a servant of God than
any fiery orb which pours its light through boundless
space. We find ignorance of man and therefore of his
Maker in Bildad's speech. He does not understand
the dignity of the human mind in its straining after
righteousness. "With limitless duration, with boundless
space and number without end, Nature does at
least what she can to translate into visible form the
wealth of the creative formula. By the vastness of
the abysses into which she penetrates in the effort, the
unsuccessful effort, to house and contain the eternal
thought we may measure the greatness of the Divine
mind. For as soon as this mind goes out of itself and
seeks to explain itself, the effort at utterance heaps
universe upon universe during myriads of centuries,
and still it is not expressed and the great oration must
go on for ever and ever." The inanimate universe
majestic, ruled by eternal law, cannot represent the
moral qualities of the Divine mind, and the attempt to
convict a thinking man, whose soul is bent on truth
and purity, by the splendour of that light which dazzles
his eye, comes to nothing.</p>

<p>The commonplaces of pious thought fall stale and
flat in a controversy like the present. Bildad does not
realise wherein the right of man in the universe consists.
He is trying in vain to instruct one who sees that
moral desire and struggle are the conditions of human
greatness, who will not be overborne by material
splendours nor convicted by the accident of death.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE OUTSKIRTS OF HIS WAYS.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chaps.</span> xxvi., xxvii.</p>


<p>Beginning his reply Job is full of scorn and
sarcasm.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>How hast thou helped one without power!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>How hast thou saved the strengthless arm!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>How hast thou counselled one void of knowledge,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And plentifully declared the thing that is known!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Well indeed hast thou spoken, O man of singular
intelligence. I am very weak, my arm is powerless.
What reassurance, what generous help thou hast provided!
I, doubtless, know nothing, and thou hast
showered illumination on my darkness.&mdash;His irony is
bitter. Bildad appears almost contemptible. "<i>To
whom hast thou uttered words?</i>" Is it thy mission to
instruct me? "<i>And whose spirit came forth from thee?</i>"
Dost thou claim Divine inspiration? Job is rancorous;
and we are scarcely intended by the writer to justify
him. Yet it is galling indeed to hear that calm repetition
of the most ordinary ideas when the controversy
has been carried into the deep waters of thought. Job
desired bread and is offered a stone.</p>

<p>But since Bildad has chosen to descant upon the
greatness and imperial power of God, the subject shall
be continued. He shall be taken into the abyss beneath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
where faith recognises the Divine presence, and to the
heights above that he may learn how little of the
dominion of God lies within the range of a mind like
his, or indeed of mortal sense.</p>

<p>First there is a vivid glance at that mysterious
under-world where the shades or spirits of the departed
survive in a dim vague existence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The shades are shaken</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Beneath the waters and their inhabitants.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Sheol is naked before Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And Abaddon hath no covering.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bildad has spoken of the lofty place where God makes
peace. But that same God has the sovereignty also
of the nether world. Under the bed of the ocean and
those subterranean waters that flow beneath the solid
ground where, in the impenetrable darkness, poor
shadows of their former selves, those who lived once
on earth congregate age after age&mdash;there the power of
the Almighty is revealed. He does not always exert
His will in order to create tranquility. Down in Sheol
the <i>refaim</i> are agitated. And nothing is hid from His
eye. Abaddon, the devouring abyss, is naked before
Him.</p>

<p>Let us distinguish here between the imagery and the
underlying thought, the inspired vision of the writer
and the form in which Job is made to present it.
These notions about Sheol as a dark cavern below
earth and ocean to which the spirits of the dead are
supposed to descend are the common beliefs of the age.
They represent opinion, not reality. But there is a
new flash of inspiration in the thought that God reigns
over the abode of the dead, that even if men escape
punishment here, the judgments of the Almighty may
reach them there. This is the writer's prophetic insight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
into fact; and he properly assigns the thought
to his hero who, already almost at the point of death,
has been straining as it were to see what lies beyond
the gloomy gate. The poetry is infused with the
spirit of inquiry into God's government of the present
and the future. Set beside other passages both in
the Old and New Testaments this is found continuous
with higher revelations, even with the testimony of
Christ when He says that God is Lord not of the dead
but of the living.</p>

<p>From Sheol, the under-world, Job points to the
northern heavens ablaze with stars. God, he says,
stretches that wonderful dome over empty space&mdash;the
immovable polar star probably appearing to mark the
point of suspension. The earth, again, hangs in space
on nothing, even this solid earth on which men live and
build their cities. The writer is of course ignorant of
what modern science teaches, but he has caught the
fact which no modern knowledge can deprive of its
marvellous character. Then the gathering in immense
volumes of watery vapour, how strange is that, the
filmy clouds holding rains that deluge a continent,
yet not rent asunder. One who is wonderful in
counsel must indeed have ordered this universe; but
His throne, the radiant seat of His everlasting dominion,
He shutteth in with clouds; it is never seen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>A bound He hath set on the face of the waters,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>On the confines of light and darkness.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The pillars of heaven tremble</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And are astonished at His rebuke.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He stilleth the sea with His power;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And by His understanding He smites through Rahab:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>By His breath the heavens are made bright;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>His hand pierceth the fleeing serpent.</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Lo, these are the outskirts of His ways,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And what a whisper is that which we hear of Him!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But the thunder of His powers who can apprehend?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the confines of light and darkness God sets a
boundary, the visible horizon, the ocean being supposed
to girdle the earth on every side. The pillars
of heaven are the mountains, which might be seen
in various directions apparently supporting the sky.
With awe men looked upon them, with greater awe
felt them sometimes shaken by mysterious throbs as
if at God's rebuke. From these the poet passes to the
sea, the great storm waves that roll upon the shore.
God smites through Rahab, subdues the fierce sea&mdash;represented
as a raging monster. Here, as in the
succeeding verse where the fleeing serpent is spoken of,
reference is made to nature-myths current in the East.
The old ideas of heathen imagination are used simply
in a poetical way. Job does not believe in a dragon
of the sea, but it suits him to speak of the stormy
ocean-current under this figure so as to give vividness
to his picture of Divine power. God quells the wild
waves; His breath as a soft wind clears away the
storm clouds and the blue sky is seen again. The
hand of God pierces the fleeing serpent, the long track
of angry clouds borne swiftly across the face of the
heavens.</p>

<p>The closing words of the chapter are a testimony to
the Divine greatness, negative in form yet in effect
more eloquent than all the rest. It is but the outskirts
of the ways of God we see, a whisper of Him we hear.
The full thunder falls not on our ears. He who sits
on the throne which is for ever shrouded in clouds
and darkness is the Creator of the visible universe but
always separate from it. He reveals Himself in what
we see and hear, yet the glory, the majesty remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
concealed. The sun is not God, nor the storm, nor
the clear shining after rain. The writer is still true
to the principle of never making nature equal to
God. Even where the religion is in form a nature
religion, separateness is fully maintained. The phenomena
of the universe are but faint adumbrations of the
Divine life. Bildad may come short of the full clearness
of belief, but Job has it. The great circle of
existence the eye is able to include is but the skirt of
that garment by which the Almighty is seen.</p>

<p>The question may be asked, What place has this
poetical tribute to the majesty of God in the argument
of the book? Viewed simply as an effort to outdo
and correct the utterance of Bildad the speech is not
fully explained. We ask further what is meant to
be in Job's mind at this particular point in the discussion;
whether he is secretly complaining that power
and dominion so wide are not manifested in executing
justice on earth, or, on the other hand, comforting
himself with the thought that judgment will yet return
to righteousness and the Most High be proved the
All-just? The inquiry has special importance because,
looking forward in the book, we find that when the
voice of God is heard from the storm it proclaims His
matchless power and incomparable wisdom.</p>

<p>At present it must suffice to say that Job is now
made to come very near his final discovery that complete
reliance upon Eloah is not simply the fate but
the privilege of man. Fully to understand Divine
providence is impossible, but it can be seen that One
who is supreme in power and infinite in wisdom,
responsible always to Himself for the exercise of His
power, should have the complete confidence of His
creatures. Of this truth Job lays hold; by strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
thought he has forced his way almost through the
tangled forest, and he is a type of man at his best
on the natural plane. The world waited for the clear
light which solves the difficulties of faith. While once
and again a flash came before Christ, He brought the
abiding revelation, the dayspring from on high which
giveth light to them that sit in darkness and the
shadow of death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>According to his manner Job turns now from a
subject which may be described as speculative to his
own position and experience. The earlier part of
chap. xxvii. is an earnest declaration in the strain he
has always maintained. As vehemently as ever he
renews his claim to integrity, emphasizing it with a
solemn adjuration.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>As God liveth who hath taken away my right,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the Almighty who hath embittered my soul;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>(For still my life is whole in me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the breath of the High God in my nostrils),</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My lips do not speak iniquity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nor does my tongue utter deceit.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Far be it from me to justify you;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My righteousness I hold fast, and let it not go;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My heart reproacheth not any of my days.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is in the old tone of confident self-defence.
God has taken away his right, denied him the outward
signs of innocence, the opportunity of pleading his
cause. Yet, as a believer, he swears by the life of
God that he is a true man, a righteous man. Whatever
betides he will not fall from that conviction and claim.
And let no one say that pain has impaired his reason,
that now if never before he is speaking deliriously.
No: his life is whole in him; God-given life is his,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and with the consciousness of it he speaks, not ignorant
of what is a man's duty, not with a lie in his right
hand, but with absolute sincerity. He will not justify
his accusers, for that would be to deny righteousness,
the very rock which alone is firm beneath his feet.
Knowing what is a man's obligation to his fellow-men
and to God he will repeat his self-defence. He goes
back upon his past, he reviews his days. Upon none
of them can his conscience fix the accusation of
deliberate baseness or rebellion against God.</p>

<p>Having affirmed his sincerity Job proceeds to show
what would be the result of deceit and hypocrisy at
so solemn a crisis of his life. The underlying idea
seems to be that of communion with the Most High,
the spiritual fellowship necessary to man's inner life.
He could not speak falsely without separating himself
from God and therefore from hope. As yet he is not
rejected; the consciousness of truth remains with him,
and through that he is in touch at least with Eloah.
No voice from on high answers him; yet this Divine
principle of life remains in his soul. Shall he renounce
it?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Let mine enemy be as the wicked,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And he that riseth against me as the unrighteous.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If I have aught to do with a wicked man such as I
am now to describe, one who would pretend to pure
and godly life while he had behaved in impious defiance
of righteousness, if I have to do with such a man, let
it be as an enemy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For what is the hope of the godless whom He cutteth off,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When God taketh his soul?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Will God hear his cry</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When trouble cometh upon him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Will he delight himself in the Almighty</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And call upon Eloah at all times?</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The topic is access to God by prayer, that sense
of security which depends on the Divine friendship.
There comes one moment at least, there may be many,
in which earthly possessions are seen to be worthless
and the help to the Almighty is alone to any avail.
In order to enjoy hope at such a time a man must
habitually live with God in sincere obedience. The
godless man previously described, the thief, the adulterer
whose whole life is a cowardly lie, is cut off from
the Almighty. He finds no resource in the Divine
friendship. To call upon God always is no privilege
of his; he has lost it by neglect and revolt. Job
speaks of the case of such a man as in contrast to his
own. Although his own prayers remain apparently unanswered
he has a reserve of faith and hope. Before
God he can still assure himself as the servant of His
righteousness, in fellowship with Him who is eternally
true. The address closes with these words of retrospection
(vv. 11, 12):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I would teach you concerning the hand of God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That which is with Shaddai would I not conceal.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Why then are ye become altogether vain?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this point begins a passage which creates great
difficulty. It is ascribed to Job, but is entirely out of
harmony with all he has said. May we accept the
conjecture that it is the missing third speech of Zophar,
erroneously incorporated with the "parable" of Job?
Do the contents warrant this departure from the received
text?</p>

<p>All along Job's contention has been that though an
evil-doer could have no fellowship with God, no joy in
God, yet such a man might succeed in his schemes,
amass wealth, live in glory, go down to his grave in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
peace. Yea, he might be laid in a stately tomb and
the very clods of the valley might be sweet to him.
Job has not affirmed this to be always the history of
one who defies the Divine law. But he has said that
often it is; and the deep darkness in which he himself
lies is not caused so much by his calamity and disease
as by the doubt forced upon him whether the Most High
does rule in steadfast justice on this earth. How comes
it, he has cried again and again, that the wicked prosper
and the good are often reduced to poverty and sorrow?</p>

<p>Now does the passage from the twelfth verse onwards
correspond with this strain of thought? It describes
the fate of the wicked oppressor in strong language&mdash;defeat,
desolation, terror, rejection by God, rejection by
men. His children are multiplied only for the sword.
Sons die and widows are left disconsolate. His treasures,
his garments shall not be for his delight; the
innocent shall enjoy his substance. His sudden death
shall be in shame and agony, and men shall clap their
hands at him and hiss him out of his place. Clearly,
if Job is the speaker, he must be giving up all he has
hitherto contended for, admitting that his friends have
argued truly, that after all judgment does fall in this
world upon arrogant men. The motive of the whole
controversy would be lost if Job yielded this point.
It is not as if the passage ran, This or that may take
place, this or that may befall the evil-doer. Eliphaz,
Bildad, and Zophar never present more strongly their
own view than that view is presented here. Nor can
it be said that the writer may be preparing for the
confession Job makes after the Almighty has spoken
from the storm. When he gives way then, it is only
to the extent of withdrawing his doubts of the wisdom
and justice of the Divine rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>The suggestion that Job is here reciting the statements
of his friends cannot be entertained. To read
"Why are ye altogether vain, <i>saying</i>, This is the
portion of the wicked man from God," is incompatible
with the long and detailed account of the oppressor's
overthrow and punishment. There would be no point
or force in mere recapitulation without the slightest
irony or caricature. The passage is in grim earnest.
On the other hand, to imagine that Job is modifying
his former language is, as Dr. A. B. Davidson shows,
equally out of the question. With his own sons and
daughters lying in their graves, his own riches dispersed,
would he be likely to say&mdash;"<i>If his children be multiplied
it is for the sword</i>"? and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Though he heap up silver as the dust,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And prepare raiment as the clay;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the innocent shall divide the silver</i>"?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Against supposing this to be Zophar's third speech
the arguments drawn from the brevity of Bildad's last
utterance and the exhaustion of the subjects of debate
have little weight, and there are distinct points of
resemblance between the passage under consideration
and Zophar's former addresses. Assuming it to be his,
it is seen to begin precisely where he left off;&mdash;only he
adopts the distinction Job has pointed out and confines
himself now to "oppressors." His last speech closed
with the sentence: "This is the portion of a wicked
man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by
God." He begins here (ver. 13): "This is the portion
of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors
which they receive from the Almighty." Again, without
verbal identity, the expressions "God shall cast
the fierceness of His wrath upon him" (chap. xx. 23),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
and "God shall hurl upon him and not spare"
(chap. xxvii. 21), show the same style of representation,
as also do the following: "Terrors are upon him....
His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath"
(chap. xx. 25, 28), and "Terrors overtake him like
waters" (chap. xxvii. 20). Other similarities may be
easily traced; and on the whole it seems by far the
best explanation of an otherwise incomprehensible
passage to suppose that here Zophar is holding doggedly
to opinions which the other two friends have renounced.
Job could not have spoken the passage, and there is
no reason for considering it to be an interpolation by
a later hand.</p>

<p>The controversy at length closed, the poet breaks
into a chant of the quest of Wisdom. It can
hardly be supposed to have been uttered or sung
by Job. But if we may go so far as to imagine a
chorus after the manner of the Greek dramas, this
ode would fitly come as a choral descant reflecting
on the vain attempts made alike by Job and by
his friends to penetrate the secrets of Divine providence.
How poor and unsatisfying is all that has
been said. To fathom the purposes of the Most High,
to trace through the dark shadows and entanglements
of human life that unerring righteousness with which
all events are ordered and overruled&mdash;how far was
this above the sagacity of the speakers. Now and
again true things have been said, now and again
glimpses of that vindication of the good which should
compensate for all their sufferings have brightened
the controversy. But the reconciliation has not been
found. The purposes of the Most High remain untraced.
The poet is fully aware of this, aware even
that on the ground of argument he is unable to work
out the problem which he has opened. With an undertone
of wistful sadness, remembering passages of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
country's poetry that ran in too joyous a strain, as if
wisdom lay within the range of human ken, he suspends
the action of the drama for a little to interpose this cry
of limitation and unrest. There is no complaint that
God keeps in his own hand sublime secrets of Design.
What is man that he should be discontented with his
place and power? It is enough for him that the Great
God rules in righteous sovereignty, gives him laws of
conduct to be obeyed in reverence, shows him the evil
he is to avoid, the good he is to follow. "The things
of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God." Those
who have a world to explore and use, the Almighty to
adore and trust, if they must seek after the secret of
existence and ever feel themselves baffled in the endeavour,
may still live nobly, bear patiently, find blessed
life within the limit God has set.</p>

<p>First the industry of man is depicted, that search
for the hidden things of the earth which is significant
alike of the craving and ingenuity of the human mind.</p>

where mines of copper and gold were wrought by the
Egyptians, the various operations here described. Digging
or quarrying, driving tunnels horizontally into the
hills or sinking shafts in the valleys, letting themselves
down by ropes from the edge of a cliff to reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
vein, then, suspended in mid air, hewing at the ore,
the miners variously ply their craft. Away in remote
gorges of the hills the pits they have dug remain
abandoned, forgotten. The long winding passages
they make seem to track to the utmost limit the stones
of darkness, stones that are black with the richness of
the ore.</p>

<p>On the earth's surface men till their fields, but the
hidden treasures that lie below are more valuable than
the harvest of maize or wheat.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And from beneath it is turned up as by fire.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And it hath dust of gold.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reference to fire as an agent in turning up the
earth appears to mark a volcanic district, but sapphires
and gold are found either in alluvial soil or associated
with gneiss and quartz. Perhaps the fire was that used
by the miners to split refractory rock. And the cunning
of man is seen in this, that he carries into the very
heart of the mountains a path which no vulture or
falcon ever saw, which the proud beasts and fierce
lions have not trodden.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He overturneth mountains by the roots.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slowly indeed as compared with modern work of the
kind, yet surely, where those earnest toilers desired a
way, excavations went on and tunnels were formed
with wedge and hammer and pickaxe. The skill of
man in providing tools and devising methods, and his
patience and assiduity made him master of the very
mountains. And when he had found the ore he could
extract its precious metal and gems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He cutteth out channels among the rocks;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And his eye seeth every precious thing.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the hidden thing brings he forth to light.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For washing his ore when it has been crushed he
needs supplies of water, and to this end makes long
aqueducts. In Idumæa a whole range of reservoirs
may still be seen, by means of which even in the dry
season the work of gold-washing might be carried on
without interruption. No particle of the precious
metal escaped the quick eye of the practised miner.
And again, if water began to percolate into his shaft or
tunnel, he had skill to bind the streams that his search
might not be hindered.</p>

<p>Such then is man's skill, such are his perseverance
and success in the quest of things he counts valuable&mdash;iron
for his tools, copper to fashion into vessels, gold
and silver to adorn the crowns of kings, sapphires to
gleam upon their raiment. And if in the depths of
earth or anywhere the secrets of life could be reached,
men of eager adventurous spirit would sooner or later
find them out.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that, in the account given here of
the search after hidden things, attention is confined to
mining operations. And this may appear strange, the
general subject being the quest of wisdom, that is understanding
of the principles and methods by which the
Divine government of the world is carried on. There
was in those days a method of research, widely practised,
to which some allusion might have been expected&mdash;the
so-called art of astrology. The Chaldæans had
for centuries observed the stars, chronicled their apparent
movements, measured the distances of the planets
from each other in their unexplained progress through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the constellations. On this survey of the heavens was
built up a whole code of rules for predicting events. The
stars which culminated at the time of any one's birth,
the planets visible when an undertaking was begun, were
supposed to indicate prosperity or disaster. The author
of the Book of Job could not be ignorant of this art.
Why does he not mention it? Why does he not point
out that by watching the stars man seeks in vain to
penetrate Divine secrets? And the reply would seem
to be that keeping absolute silence in regard to astrology
he meant to refuse it as a method of inquiry. Patient,
eager labour among the rocks and stones is the type
of fruitful endeavour. Astrology is not in any way
useful; nothing is reached by that method of questioning
nature.</p>

<p>The poet proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Where shall wisdom be found,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And where is the place of understanding?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Man knoweth not the way thereof,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Neither is it to be found in the land of the living.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The deep saith, It is not in me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the sea saith, It is not with me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The whole range of the physical cosmos, whether
open to the examination of man or beyond his reach,
is here declared incapable of supplying the clue to that
underlying idea by which the course of things is ordered.
The land of the living is the surface of the earth which
men inhabit. The deep is the under-world. Neither
there nor in the sea is the great secret to be found.
As for its price, however earnestly men may desire to
possess themselves of it, no treasures are of any use
it is not to be bought in any market.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Never is wisdom got for gold,</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nor for its price can silver be told.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For the gold of Ophir it may not be won,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The onyx rare or the sapphire stone.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Gold is no measure and glass no hire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Jewels of gold twice fined by fire.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Coral and crystal tell in vain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Pearls of the deep for wisdom's gain.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Topaz of Cush avails thee nought,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nor with gold of glory is it bought.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While wisdom is thus of value incommensurate with all
else men count precious and rare, it is equally beyond
the reach of all other forms of mundane life. The
birds that soar high into the atmosphere see nothing
of it, nor does any creature that wanders far into
uninhabitable wilds. Abaddon and Death indeed, the
devouring abyss and that silent world which seems to
gather and keep all secrets, have heard a rumour of it.
Beyond the range of mortal sense some hint there may
be of a Divine plan governing the mutations of existence,
the fulfilment of which will throw light on the underworld
where the spirits of the departed wait in age-long
night. But death has no knowledge any more than
life. Wisdom is God's prerogative, His activities are
His own to order and fulfil.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>God understandeth the way thereof,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He knoweth the place thereof.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For He looketh to the ends of the earth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And seeth under the whole heaven,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Making weight for the winds;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He meteth out the waters by measure.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When He made a decree for the rain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And a way for the lightning of thunder,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then did He see it and number it,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He established it, yea, and searched it out.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The evolution, as we should say, of the order of
nature gives fixed and visible embodiment to the
wisdom of God. We must conclude, therefore, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
the poet indicates the complete idea of the world as a
cosmos governed by subtle all-pervading law for moral
ends. The creation of the visible universe is assumed
to begin, and with the created before Him God sees its
capacities, determines the use to which its forces are
to be put, the relation all things are to have to each
other, to the life of man and to His own glory. But
the hokhma or understanding of this remains for ever
beyond the discovery of the human intellect. Man
knoweth not the way thereof. The forces of earth and
air and sea and the deep that lieth under do not reveal
the secret of their working; they are but instruments.
And the end of all is not to be found in Sheol, in the
silent world of the dead. God Himself is the Alpha
and Omega, the First and the Last.</p>

<p>Yet man has his life and his law. Though intellectual
understanding of his world and destiny may fail however
earnestly he pursues the quest, he should obtain
the knowledge that comes by reverence and obedience.
He can adore God, he can distinguish good from evil
and seek what is right and true. There lies his hokhma,
there, says the poet, it must continue to lie.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>And unto man He said,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And to depart from evil is understanding.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The conclusion lays a hush upon man's thought&mdash;but
leaves it with a doctrine of God and faith reaching above
the limitations of time and sense. Reverence for the
Divine will not fully known, the pursuit of holiness,
fear of the Unseen God are no agnosticism, they are the
true springs of religious life.</p>

<p class="center"><i>AS A PRINCE BEFORE THE KING.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Job speaks. Chaps.</span> xxix.-xxxi.</p>


<p>From the pain and desolation to which he has
become inured as a pitiable second state of
existence, Job looks back to the years of prosperity
and health which in long succession he once enjoyed.
This parable or review of the past ends his contention.
Honour and blessedness are apparently denied him for
ever. With what has been he compares his present
misery and proceeds to a bold and noble vindication of
his character alike from secret and from flagrant sins.</p>

<p>In the whole circle of Job's lamentations this chant
is perhaps the most affecting. The language is very
beautiful, in the finest style of the poet, and the minor
cadences of the music are such as many of us can
sympathise with. When the years of youth go by and
strength wanes, the Eden we once dwelt in seems
passing fair. Of those beyond middle life there are
few who do not set their early memories in sharp
contrast to the ways they now travel, looking back to
a happy valley and long bright summers that are left
behind. And even in opening manhood and womanhood
the troubles of life often fall, as we may think,
prematurely, coming between the mind and the
remembered joy of burdenless existence.</p>

<p>First in the years past Job sees by the light of memory
the blessedness he had when the Almighty was felt to
be his preserver and his strength. Though now God
appears to have become an enemy he will not deny
that once he had a very different experience. Then
nature was friendly, no harm came to him; he was
not afraid of the pestilence that walketh in darkness
nor the destruction that wasteth at noon-day, for the
Almighty was his refuge and fortress. To refuse this
tribute of gratitude is far from the mind of Job, and
the expression of it is a sign that now at length he is
come to a better mind. He seems on the way fully to
recover his trust.</p>

<p>The elements of his former happiness are recounted
in detail. God watched over him with constant care,
the lamp of Divine love shone on high and lighted up
the darkness, so that even in the night he could travel
by a way he knew not and feel secure. Days of strength
and pleasure were those when the secret of God, the
sense of intimate fellowship with God, was on his
tent, when his children were about him, that beautiful
band of sons and daughters who were his pride. Then
his steps were bathed in abundance, butter provided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
innumerable kine, rivers of oil which seemed to flow
from the rock, where terrace above terrace the olives
grew luxuriantly and yielded their fruit without fail.</p>

<p>Chiefly Job remembers with gratitude to God the
esteem in which he was held by all about him. Nature
was friendly and not less friendly were men. When
he went into the city and took his seat in the "broad
place" within the gate, he was acknowledged chief
of the council and court of judgment. The young
men withdrew and stood aside, yea the elders, already
seated in the place of assembly, stood up to receive
him as their superior in position and wisdom. Discussion
was suspended that he might hear and decide.
And the reasons for this respect are given. In the society
thus with idyllic touches represented, two qualities were
highly esteemed&mdash;regard for the poor and wisdom in
counsel. Then, as now, the problem of poverty caused
great concern to the elders of cities. Though the population
of an Arabian town could not be great, there were
many widows and fatherless children, families reduced
to beggary by disease or the failure of their poor means
of livelihood, blind and lame persons utterly dependent
on charity, besides wandering strangers and the
vagrants of the desert. By his princely munificence to
these Job had earned the gratitude of the whole region.
Need was met, poverty relieved, justice done in every
case. He recounts what he did, not in boastfulness,
but as one who rejoiced in the ability God had given
him to aid suffering fellow-creatures. Those were indeed
royal times for the generous-hearted man. Full
of public spirit, his ear and hand always open, giving
freely out of his abundance, he commended himself to
the affectionate regard of the whole valley. The ready
way of almsgiving was that alone by which relief was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
provided for the destitute, and Job was never appealed
to in vain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The ear that heard me blessed me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The eye that saw bare witness to me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Because I delivered the poor that cried,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the fatherless who had no helper.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The blessing of him that was ready to die came upon me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And I caused the widow's heart to sing with joy.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So far Job rejoices in the recollection of what he had
been able to do for the distressed and needy in those
days when the lamp of God shone over him. He
proceeds to speak of his service as magistrate or judge.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I put on righteousness and it indued itself with me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My justice was as a robe and a diadem;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I was eyes to the blind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And feet was I to the lame.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With righteousness in his heart so that all he said and
did revealed it and wearing judgment as a turban, he
sat and administered justice among the people. Those
who had lost their sight and were unable to find the
men that had wronged them came to him and he was
as eyes to them, following up every clue to the crime
that had been committed. The lame who could not
pursue their enemies appealed to him and he took up
their cause. The poor, suffering under oppression,
found him a protector, a father. Yea, "<i>the cause of
him that I knew not I searched out</i>." On behalf of total
strangers as well as of neighbours he set in motion the
machinery of justice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>And I brake the jaws of the wicked</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And plucked the spoil from his teeth.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>None were so formidable, so daring and lion-like, but
he faced them, brought them to judgment and compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
them to give up what they had taken by fraud and
violence.</p>

<p>In those days, Job confesses, he had the dream
that as he was prosperous, powerful, helpful to others
by the grace of God, so he would continue. Why
should any trouble fall on one who used power conscientiously
for his neighbours? Would not Eloah
sustain the man who was as a god to others?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Then I said, I shall die in my nest,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And I shall multiply my days as the Ph&#339;nix;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My root shall spread out by the waters,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the dew shall be all night on my branch;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My glory shall be fresh in me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And my bow shall be renewed in my hand.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A fine touch of the dream-life which ran on from year
to year, bright and blessed as if it would flow for ever.
Death and disaster were far away. He would renew
his life like the Ph&#339;nix, attain to the age of the antediluvian
fathers, and have his glory or life strong in
him for uncounted years. So illusion flattered him, the
very image he uses pointing to the futility of the hope.</p>

<p>The closing strophe of the chapter proceeds with
even stronger touch and more abundant colour to represent
his dignity. Men listened to him and waited.
Like a refreshing rain upon thirsty ground&mdash;and how
thirsty the desert could be!&mdash;his counsel fell on their
ears. He smiled upon them when they had no confidence,
laughed away their trouble, the light of his
countenance never dimmed by their apprehensions.
Even when all about him were in dismay his hearty
hopeful outlook was unclouded. Trusting God, he
knew his own strength and gave freely of it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I chose out their way, and sat as a chief,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And dwelt as a king in the crowd,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As one that comforteth the mourners.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Looked up to with this great esteem, acknowledged
leader in virtue of his overflowing goodness and cheerfulness,
he seemed to make sunshine for the whole
community. Such was the past. All that had been,
is gone apparently for ever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How inexpressibly strange that power so splendid,
mental, physical and moral strength used in the service
of less favoured men should be destroyed by Eloah!
It is like blotting out the sun from heaven and leaving
a world in darkness. And most strange of all is the
way in which low men assist the ruin that has been
wrought.</p>

<p>The thirtieth chapter begins with this. Job is derided
by the miserable and base whose fathers he would have
disdained to set with the dogs of his flock. He paints
these people, gaunt with hunger and vice, herding in
the wilderness where alone they are suffered to exist,
plucking mallows or salt-wort among the bushes and
digging up the roots of broom for food. Men hunted
them into the desert, crying after them as thieves, and
they dwelt in the clefts of the wadies, in caves and
amongst rocks. Like wild asses they brayed in the
scrub and flung themselves down among the nettles.
Children they were of fools, base-born, men who had
dishonoured their humanity and been whipped out of
the land. Such are they whose song and by-word Job
is now become. These, even these abhor him and
spit in his face. He makes the contrast deep and
dreadful as to his own experience and the moral confusion
that has followed Eloah's strange work. For
good there is evil, for light and order there is darkness.
Does God desire this, ordain it?</p>

<p>One is inclined to ask whether the abounding compassion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and humaneness of the Book of Job fails at
this point. These wretched creatures who make their
lair like wild beasts among the nettles, outcasts, branded
as thieves, a wandering base-born race, are still men.
Their fathers may have fallen into the vices of abject
poverty. But why should Job say that he would have
disdained to set them with the dogs of his flock? In
a previous speech (chap. xxiv.) he described victims of
oppression who had no covering in the cold and were
drenched with the rain of the mountains, clinging to
the rock for shelter; and of them he spoke gently,
sympathetically. But here he seems to go beyond
compassion.</p>

<p>Perhaps one might say the tone he takes now is
pardonable, or almost pardonable, because these wretched
beings, whom he may have treated kindly once, have
seized the occasion of his misery and disease to insult
him to his face. While the words appear hard, the
uselessness of the pariah may be the main point. Yet
a little of the pride of birth clings to Job. In this
respect he is not perfect; here his prosperous life needs
a check. The Almighty must speak to him out of the
tempest that he may feel himself and find "the blessedness
of being little."</p>

<p>These outcasts throw off all restraint and behave
with disgraceful rudeness in his presence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Upon my right hand rise the low brood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They push away my feet,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And cast up against me their ways of destruction;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They mar my path,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And force on my calamity&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They who have no helper.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They come in as through a wide breach,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In the desolation they roll themselves upon me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The various images, of a besieging army, of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
wantonly break up paths made with difficulty, of a
breach in the embankment of a river, are to show that
Job is now accounted one of the meanest, whom any
man may treat with indignity. He was once the idol
of the populace; "now none so poor to do him reverence."
And this persecution by base men is only a
sign of deeper abasement. As a horde of terrors sent
by God he feels the reproaches and sorrows of his
state.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Terrors are turned upon me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They chase away mine honour as the wind,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And my welfare passeth as a cloud.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And now my soul is poured out in me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thought shifts naturally to the awful disease which
has caused his body to swell and to become black as
with dust and ashes. And this leads him to his final
vehement complaint against Eloah. How can He so
abase and destroy His servant?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I cry unto Thee and Thou dost not hear me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I stand up, and Thou lookest at me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou art turned to be cruel unto me:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>With the might of Thine hand Thou persecutest me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Thou liftest me up to the wind, Thou causest me to ride on it;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And Thou dissolvest me in the storm.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And to the house appointed for all living.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet in overthrow doth not one stretch out his hand?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>In destruction, doth he not because of this utter a cry?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Standing up in his wretchedness he is fully visible
to the Divine eye, still no prayer moves Eloah the
terrible from His purpose. It seems to be finally appointed
that in dishonour Job shall die. Yet, destined
to this fate, his hope a mockery, shall he not stretch
out his hand, cry aloud as life falls to the grave in
ruin? How differently is God treating him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
way in which he treated those who were in trouble!
He is asking in vain that pity which he himself had
often shown. Why should this be? How can it be,
and Eloah remain the Just and Living One? Pained
without and within, unable to refrain from crying out
when people gather about him, a brother to jackals
whose howlings are heard all night, a companion to
the grieving ostrich, his bones burned by raging fever,
his harp turned to wailing and his lute into the voice
of them that weep, he can scarce believe himself the
same man that once walked in honour and gladness in
the sight of earth and heaven.</p>

<p>Thus the full measure of complaint is again poured
out, unchecked by thought that dignity of life comes
more with suffering patiently endured than with pleasure.
Job does not know that out of trouble like his a man
may rise more human, more noble, his harp furnished
with new strings of deeper feeling, a finer light of
sympathy shining in his soul. Consistently, throughout,
the author keeps this thought in the background,
showing hopeless sorrow, affliction, unrelieved by any
sense of spiritual gain, pressing with heaviest and most
weary weight upon a good man's life. The only help
Job has is the consciousness of virtue, and that does
not check his complaint. The antinomies of life, the
past as compared with the present, Divine favour exchanged
for cruel persecution, well-doing followed by
most grievous pain and dishonour, are to stand at the
last full in view. Then He who has justice in His
keeping shall appear. God Himself shall declare and
claim His supremacy and His design.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This purpose of the author achieved, the last passage
of Job's address&mdash;chap. xxxi.&mdash;rings bold and clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
like the chant of a victor, not serene indeed in the
presence of death, for this is not the Hebrew temper
and cannot be ascribed by the writer to his hero, yet
with firm ground beneath his feet, a clear conscience
of truth lighting up his soul. The language is that of
an innocent man before his accusers and his judge, yea
of a prince in presence of the King. Out of the darkness
into which he has been cast by false arguments and
accusations, out of the trouble into which his own
doubt has brought him, Job seems to rise with a new
sense of moral strength and even of restored physical
power. No more in reckless challenge of heaven and
earth to do their worst, but with a fine strain of earnest
desire to be clear with men and God, he takes up and
denies one by one every possible charge of secret and
open sin. Is the language he uses more emphatic than
any man has a right to employ? If he speaks the
truth, why should his words be thought too bold? The
Almighty Judge desires no man falsely to accuse himself,
will have no man leave an unfounded suspicion
resting upon his character. It is not evangelical meekness
to plead guilty to sins never committed. Job feels
it part of his integrity to maintain his integrity; and
here he vindicates himself not in general terms but
in detail, with a decision which cannot be mistaken.
Afterwards, when the Almighty has spoken, he acknowledges
the ignorance and error which have entered into
his judgment, making the confession we must all make
even after years of faith.</p>

<p>I. From the taint of lustful and base desire he first
clears himself. He has been pure in life, innocent
even of wandering looks which might have drawn him
into uncleanness. He has made a covenant with his
eyes and kept it. Sin of this kind, he knew, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
brings retribution, and no indulgence of his ever caused
sorrow and dishonour. Regarding the particular form
of evil in question he asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For what is the portion from God above,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the heritage of the Almighty from on high?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And disaster to them that work iniquity?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Grouped along with this "lust of the flesh" is the
"lust of the eyes," covetous desire. The itching palm
to which money clings, false dealing for the sake of
gain, crafty intrigues for the acquisition of a plot of
ground or some animal&mdash;such things were far from him.
He claims to be weighed in a strict balance, and pledges
himself that as to this he will not be found wanting.
So thoroughly is he occupied with this defence that he
speaks as if still able to sow a crop and look for the
harvest. He would expect to have the produce snatched
from his hand if the vanity of greed and getting had
led him astray. Returning then to the more offensive
suspicion that he had laid wait treacherously at his
neighbour's door, he uses the most vigorous words to
show at once his detestation of such offence and the
result he believes it always to have. It is an enormity,
a nefarious thing to be punished by the judges.
More than that, it is a fire that consumes to Abaddon,
wasting a man's strength and substance so that they
are swallowed as by the devouring abyss. As to this,
Job's reading of life is perfectly sound. Wherever
society exists at all, custom and justice are made to
bear as heavily as possible on those who invade the
foundation of society and the rights of other men.
Yet the keenness with which immorality of the particular
kind is watched fans the flame of lust. Nature
appears to be engaged against itself; it may be charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
with the offence, it certainly joins in bringing the
punishment.</p>

<p>II. Another possible imputation was that as a master
or employer he had been harsh to his underlings.
Common enough it was for those in power to treat
their dependants with cruelty. Servants were often
slaves; their rights as men and women were denied.
Regarding this, the words put into the mouth of Job
are finely humane, even prophetic:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If I despised the cause of my man-servant or maid</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When they contended with me ...</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>What then shall I do when God riseth up?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And when He visiteth what shall I answer Him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Did not He that made me in the womb make him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And did not One fashion us in the womb?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rights of those who toiled for him were sacred,
not as created by any human law which for so many
hours' service might compel so much stipulated hire,
but as conferred by God. Job's servants were men
and women with an indefeasible claim to just and considerate
treatment. It was accidental, so to speak, that
Job was rich and they poor, that he was master and
they under him. Their bodies were fashioned like his,
their minds had the same capacity of thought, of
emotion, of pleasure and pain. At this point there
is no hardness of tone or pride of birth and place.
These are well-doing people to whom as head of the
clan Job stands in place of a father.</p>

<p>And his principle, to treat them as their inheritance
of the same life from the same Creator gave them a right
to be dealt with, is prophetic, setting forth the duties of
all who have power to those who toil for them. Men are
often used like beasts of burden. No tyranny on earth
is so hateful as many employers, driving on their huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
concerns at the utmost speed, dare to exercise through
representatives or underlings. The simple patriarchal
life which brought employer and employed into direct
personal relations knew little of the antagonism of
class interests and the bitterness of feeling which often
menaces revolution. None of this will cease till simplicity
be resumed and the customs which keep men in
touch with each other, even though they fail to acknowledge
themselves members of the one family of God.
When the servant who has done his best is, after years
of exhausting labour, dismissed without a hearing by
some subordinate set there to consider what are called
the "interests" of the employer&mdash;is the latter free from
blame? The question of Job, "What then shall <i>I</i> do
when God riseth up, and when He visiteth what shall
I answer Him?" strikes a note of equity and brotherliness
many so-called Christians seem never to have
heard.</p>

<p>III. To the poor, the widow, the fatherless, the
perishing, Job next refers. Beyond the circle of his
own servants there were needy persons whom he had
been charged with neglecting and even oppressing.
He has already made ample defence under this head.
If he has lifted his hand against the fatherless, having
good reason to presume that the judges would be on
his side&mdash;then may his shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade
and his arm from the collar-bone. Calamity from
God was a terror to Job, and recognising the glorious
authority which enforces the law of brotherly help he
could not have lived in proud enjoyment and selfish
contempt.</p>

<p>IV. Next he repudiates the idolatry of wealth and
the sin of adoring the creature instead of the Creator.
Rich as he was, he can affirm that he never thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
too much of his wealth, nor secretly vaunted himself
in what he had gathered. His fields brought forth
plentifully, but he never said to his soul, Thou hast
much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease,
eat, drink, and be merry. He was but a steward,
holding all at the will of God. Not as if abundance of
possessions could give him any real worth, but with
constant gratitude to his Divine Friend, he used the
world as not abusing it.</p>

<p>And for his religion: true to those spiritual ideas
which raised him far above superstition and idolatry,
even when the rising sun seemed to claim homage as
a fit emblem of the unseen Creator, or when the full
moon shining in a clear sky seemed a very goddess of
purity and peace, he had never, as others were wont
to do, carried his hand to his lips. He had seen the
worship of Baal and Ishtar, and there might have come
to him, as to whole nations, the impulses of wonder, of
delight, of religious reverence. But he can fearlessly
say that he never yielded to the temptation to adore
anything in heaven or earth. It would have been to
deny Eloah the Supreme. Dr. Davidson reminds us
here of a legend embodied in the Koran for the purpose
of impressing the lesson that worship should be paid
to the Lord of all creatures, "whose shall be the kingdom
on the day whereon the trumpet shall be sounded."
The Almighty says: "Thus did We show unto Abraham
the kingdom of heaven and earth, that he might become
of those who firmly believe. And when the night
overshadowed him he saw a star, and he said, This is
my Lord; but when it set he said, I like not those that
set. And when he saw the moon rising he said, This
is my Lord; but when he saw it set he said, Verily,
if my Lord direct me not, I shall become one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
people who go astray. And when he saw the rising
sun he said, This is my Lord; this is the greatest; but
when it set he said, O my people, verily I am clear of
that which ye associate with God; I direct my face
unto Him who hath created the heavens and the earth."
Thus from very early times to that of Mohammed
monotheism was in conflict with the form of idolatry
that naturally allured the inhabitants of Arabia. Job
confesses the attraction, denies the sin. He speaks as
if the laws of his people were strongly against sun-worship,
whatever might be done elsewhere.</p>

<p>V. He proceeds to declare that he has never rejoiced
over a fallen enemy nor sought the life of any one
with a curse. He distinguishes himself very sharply
from those who in the common Oriental way dealt
curses without great provocation, and those even who
kept them for deadly enemies. So far was this rancorous
spirit from him that friends and enemies alike
were welcome to his hospitality and help. Verse 31
means that his servants could boast of being unable to
find a single stranger who had not sat at his table.
Their business was to furnish it every day with guests.
Nor will Job allow that after the manner of men he
skilfully covered transgressions. "If, guilty of some
base thing, I concealed it, as men often do, because I
was afraid of losing caste, afraid lest the great families
would despise me...." Such a thought or fear never
presented itself to him. He could not thus have lived
a double life. All had been above-board, in the clear
light of day, ruled by one law.</p>

<p>In connection with this it is that he comes with
princely appeal to the King.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Oh that I had one to hear me!&mdash;</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold my signature&mdash;let the Almighty answer me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And oh that I had my Opponents charge!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I would bind it unto me as a crown.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I would declare unto Him the number of my steps,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>As a prince would I go near unto Him.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words are to be defended only on the ground
that the Eloah to whom a challenge is here addressed
is God misunderstood, God charged falsely with making
unfounded accusations against His servant and punishing
him as a criminal. The Almighty has not been
doing so. The vicious reasoning of the friends, the
mistaken creed of the age make it appear as if He had.
Men say to Job, You suffer because God has found
evil in you. He is requiting you according to your
iniquity. They maintain that for no other reason could
calamities have come upon him. So God is made to
appear as the man's adversary; and Job is forced to
the demonstration that he has been unjustly condemned.
"Behold my signature," he says: I state my innocence;
I set to my mark; I stand by my claim: I can do
nothing else. Let the Almighty prove me at fault.
God, you say, has a book in which His charges against
me are written out. I wish I had that book! I would
fasten it upon my shoulder as a badge of honour; yea,
I would wear it as a crown. I would show Eloah all
I have done, every step I have taken through life by
day and night. I would evade nothing. In the assurance
of integrity I would go to the King; as a prince
I would stand in His presence. There face to face
with Him whom I know to be just and righteous I
would justify myself as His servant, faithful in His
house.</p>

<p>Is it audacity, impiety? The writer of the book
does not mean it to be so understood. There is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the slightest hint that he gives up his hero. Every
claim made is true. Yet there is ignorance of God,
and that ignorance puts Job in fault so far. He does
not know God's action though he knows his own.
He ought to reason from the misunderstanding of
himself and see that he may fail to understand Eloah.
When he begins to see this he will believe that his
sufferings have complete justification in the purpose of
the Most High.</p>

<p>The ignorance of Job represents the ignorance of the
old world. Notwithstanding the tenor of his prologue
the writer is without a theory of human affliction
applicable to every case, or even to the experience of
Job. He can only say and repeat, God is supremely
wise and righteous, and for the glory of His wisdom
and righteousness He ordains all that befalls men.
The problem is not solved till we see Christ, the Captain
of our salvation, made perfect by suffering, and know
that our earthly affliction "which is for the moment
worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal
weight of glory."</p>

<p>The last verses of the chapter may seem out of place.
Job speaks as a landowner who has not encroached on
the fields of others but honestly acquired his estate,
and as a farmer who has tilled it well. This seems a
trifling matter compared with others that have been
considered. Yet, as a kind of afterthought, completing
the review of his life, the detail is natural.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If my land cry out against me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the furrows thereof weep together,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or have caused the owners to lose their life:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Let thistles grow instead of wheat</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And cockle instead of barley.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i5"><i>The words of Job are ended.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></div></div>

<p>A farmer of the right kind would have great shame
if poor crops or wet furrows cried against him, or if he
could otherwise be accused of treating the land ill.
The touch is realistic and forcible.</p>

<p>Still it is plain at the close that the character of Job
is idealised. Much may be received as matter of veritable
history; but on the whole the life is too fine, pure,
saintly for even an extraordinary man. The picture is
clearly typical. And it is so for the best reason. An
actual life would not have set the problem fully in view.
The writer's aim is to rouse thought by throwing the
contradictions of human experience so vividly upon
a prepared canvas that all may see. Why do the
righteous suffer? What does the Almighty mean?
The urgent questions of the race are made as insistent
as art and passion, ideal truth and sincerity, can make
them. Job lying in the grime of misery yet claiming
his innocence as a prince before the Eternal King,
demands on behalf of humanity the vindication of
providence, the meaning of the world scheme.</p>

<p>A personage hitherto unnamed in the course of
the drama now assumes the place of critic and judge
between Job and his friends. Elihu, son of Barachel
the Buzite, of the family of Ram, appears suddenly
and as suddenly disappears. The implication is that
he has been present during the whole of the colloquies,
and that, having patiently waited his time, he expresses
the judgment he has slowly formed on arguments to
which he has given close attention.</p>

<p>It is significant that both Elihu and his representations
are ignored in the winding up of the action. The
address of the Almighty from the storm does not take
him into account and seems to follow directly on the
close of Job's defence. It is a very obvious criticism,
therefore, that the long discourse of Elihu may be an
interpolation or an afterthought&mdash;a fresh attempt by
the author or by some later writer to correct errors
into which Job and his friends are supposed to have
fallen and to throw new light on the matter of discussion.
The textual indications are all in favour of
this view. The style of the language appears to belong
to a later time than the other parts of the book. But
to reject the address as unworthy of a place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
poem would be too summary. Elihu indeed assumes
the air of the superior person from the first, so that
one is not engaged in his favour. Yet there is an
honest, reverent and thoughtful contribution to the
subject. In some points this speaker comes nearer the
truth than Job or any of his friends, although the address
as a whole is beneath the rest of the book in respect
of matter and argument, and still more in poetical
feeling and expression.</p>

<p>It is suggested by M. Renan that the original author,
taking up his work again after a long interval, at a
period in his life when he had lost his verve and his
style, may have added this fragment with the idea of
completing the poem. There are strong reasons against
such an explanation. For one thing there seems to be
a misconception where, at the outset, Elihu is made to
assume that Job and his friends are very old. The
earlier part of the poem by no means affirms this. Job,
though we call him a patriarch, was not necessarily far
advanced in life, and Zophar appears considerably
younger. Again the contention in the eighth verse&mdash;"There
is a spirit in man, and the breath of the
Almighty giveth them understanding"&mdash;seems to be
the justification a later writer would think it needful
to introduce. He acknowledges the Divine gift of the
original poet and adding his criticism claims for Elihu,
that is, for himself, the lucidity God bestows on every
calm and reverent student of His ways. This is considerably
different from anything we find in the addresses
of the other speakers. It seems to show that the question
of inspiration had arisen and passed through some
discussion. But the rest of the book is written without
any consciousness, or at all events any admission of
such a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>Elihu appears to represent the new "wisdom" which
came to Hebrew thinkers in the period of the exile;
and there are certain opinions embodied in his address
which must have been formed during an exile
that brought many Jews to honour. The reading of
affliction given is one following the discovery that the
general sinfulness of a nation may entail chastisement
on men who have not personally been guilty of great
sin, yet are sharers in the common neglect of religion
and pride of heart, and further that this chastisement
may be the means of great profit to those who suffer.
It would be harsh to say the tone is that of a mind
which has caught the trick of "voluntary humility," of
pietistic self-abasement. Yet there are traces of such
a tendency, the beginning of a religious strain opposed
to legal self-righteousness, running, however, very
readily to excess and formalism. Elihu, accordingly,
appears to stand on the verge of a descent from the
robust moral vigour of the original author towards that
low ground in which false views of man's nature hinder
the free activity of faith.</p>

<p>The note struck by the Book of Job had stirred
eager thought in the time of the exile. Just as in the
Middle Ages of European history the Divine Comedy
of Dante was made a special study, and chairs were
founded in universities for its exposition, so less
formally the drama of Job was made the subject of
inquiry and speculation. We suppose then that among
the many who wrote on the poem, one acting for a
circle of thinkers incorporated their views in the text.
He could not do so otherwise than by bringing a new
speaker on the stage. To add anything to what
Eliphaz or Bildad or Job had said would have prevented
the free expression of new opinion. Nor could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
he without disrespect have inserted the criticism after
the words of Jehovah. Selecting as the only proper
point of interpolation the close of the debate between
Job and the friends, the scribe introduced the Elihu
portion as a review of the whole scope of the book,
and may indeed have subtly intended to assail as
entirely heterodox the presupposition of Job's integrity
and the Almighty's approval of his servant. That
being his purpose, he had to veil it in order to
keep the discourse of Elihu in line with the place
assigned to him in the dramatic movement. The contents
of the prologue and epilogue and the utterance
of the Almighty from the storm affect, throughout, the
added discourse. But to secure the unity of the poem
the writer makes Elihu speak like one occupying the
same ground as Eliphaz and the others, that of a
thinker ignorant of the original motive of the drama;
and this is accomplished with no small skill. The
assumption is that reverent thought may throw new
light, far more light than the original author possessed,
on the case as it stood during the colloquies. Elihu
avoids assailing the conception of the prologue that
Job is a perfect and upright man approved by God.
He takes the state of the sufferer as he finds it, and
inquires how and why it is, what is the remedy.
There are pedantries and obscurities in the discourse,
yet the author must not be denied the merit of a careful
and successful attempt to adapt his character to the
place he occupies in the drama. Beyond this, and the
admission that something additional is said on the subject
of Divine discipline, it is needless to go in justifying
Elihu's appearance. One can only remark with wonder
in passing that Elihu should ever have been declared the
Angel Jehovah, or a personification of the Son of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>The narrative verses which introduce the new speaker
state that his wrath was kindled against Job because
he justified himself rather than God, and against the
three friends because they had condemned Job and yet
found no answer to his arguments. The mood is that
of a critic rather hot, somewhat too confident that he
knows, beginning a task that requires much penetration
and wisdom. But the opening sentences of the speech
of Elihu betray the need the writer felt to justify himself
in making his bold venture.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I am young and ye are very old;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Wherefore I held back and durst not show my knowledge.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I thought, Days should speak,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the multitude of years teach wisdom.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Still, there is a spirit in man,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Not the great in years are wise,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nor do the aged understand what is right.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Therefore I say: Hearken to me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I also will show my opinion.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These verses are a defence of the new writer's boldness
in adding to a poem that has come down from a
previous age. He is confident in his judgment, yet
realises the necessity of commending it to the hearers.
He claims that inspiration which belongs to every
reverent conscientious inquirer. On this footing he
affirms a right to express his opinion, and the right
cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Elihu has been disappointed with the speeches of Job's
friends. He has listened for their reasons, observed
how they cast about for arguments and theories; but
no one said anything convincing. It is an offence
to this speaker that men who had so good a case
against their friend made so little of it. The intelligence
of Elihu is therefore from the first committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
to the hypothesis that Job is in the wrong. Obviously
the writer places his spokesman in a position which the
epilogue condemns; and if we assume this to have been
deliberately done a subtle verdict against the scope of the
poem must have been intended. May it not be surmised
that this implied comment or criticism gave the interpolated
discourse value in the eyes of many? Originally
the poem appeared somewhat dangerous, out of the line
of orthodoxy. It may have become more acceptable to
Hebrew thought when this caveat against bold assumptions
of human perfectibility and the right of man in
presence of his Maker had been incorporated with the
text.</p>

<p>Elihu tells the friends that they are not to say, We
have found wisdom in Job, unexpected wisdom which
the Almighty alone is able to vanquish. They are not
to excuse themselves nor exaggerate the difficulties of
the situation by entertaining such an opinion. Elihu
is confident that he can overcome Job in reasoning.
As if speaking to himself he describes the perplexity
of the friends and states his intention.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>They were amazed, they answered no more;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They had not a word to say.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And shall I wait because they speak not,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Because they stand still and answer no more?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I also will answer my part,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I also will show my opinion.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His convictions become stronger and more urgent.
He must open his lips and answer. And he will use
no flattery. Neither the age nor the greatness of the
men he is addressing shall keep him from speaking his
mind. If he were insincere he would bring on himself
the judgment of God. "My Maker would soon take
me away." Here again the second writer's self-defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
colours the words put into Elihu's mouth. Reverence
for the genius of the poet whose work he is supplementing
does not prevent a greater reverence for his
own views.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The general exordium closes with the thirty-second
chapter, and in the thirty-third Elihu, addressing Job
by name, enters on a new vindication of his right to
intervene. His claim is still that of straightforwardness,
sincerity. He is to express what he knows without
any other motive than to throw light on the matter in
hand. He feels himself, moreover, to be guided by the
Divine Spirit. The breath of the Almighty has given
him life; and on this ground he considers himself
entitled to enter the discussion and ask of Job what
answer he can give. This is done with dramatic feeling.
The life he enjoys is not only physical vigour
as contrasted with Job's diseased and infirm state,
but also intellectual strength, the power of God-given
reason. Yet, as if he might seem to claim too much,
he hastens to explain that he is quite on Job's level
nevertheless.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold, I am before God even as thou art;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I also am formed out of the clay.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Lo, my terror shall not make thee afraid,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elihu is no great personage, no heaven-sent prophet
whose oracles must be received without question. He
is not terrible like God, but a man formed out of the
clay. The dramatising appears overdone at this point,
and can only be explained by the desire of the writer
to keep on good terms with those who already reverenced
the original poet and regarded his work as sacred.
What is now to be said to Job is spoken with knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and conviction, yet without pretension to more
than the wisdom of the holy. There is, however, a
covert attack on the original author as having made
too much of the terror of the Almighty, the constant
pain and anxiety that bore down Job's spirit. No
excuse of the kind is to be allowed for the failure of
Job to justify himself. He did not <i>because he could not</i>.
The fact was, according to this critic, that Job had no
right of self-defence as perfect and upright, without
fault before the Most High. No man possessed or
could acquire such integrity. And all the attempts of
the earlier dramatist to put arguments and defences
into his hero's mouth had of necessity failed. The
new writer comprehends very well the purpose of his
predecessor and intends to subvert it.</p>

<p>The formal indictment opens thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And I have heard thy words:&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I am clean without transgression;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold, He findeth occasions against me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He counteth me for His enemy;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He putteth me in the stocks,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He marketh all my paths.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The claim of righteousness, the explanation of his
troubles given by Job that God made occasions against
him and without cause treated him as an enemy, are
the errors on which Elihu fastens. They are the errors
of the original writer. No one endeavouring to represent
the feelings and language of a servant of God
should have placed him in the position of making so false
a claim, so base a charge against Eloah. Such criticism
is not to be set aside as either incompetent or over
bold. But the critic has to justify his opinion, and, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
many others, when he comes to give reasons his weakness
discloses itself. He is certainly hampered by the
necessity of keeping within dramatic lines. Elihu must
appear and speak as one who stood beside Job with
the same veil between him and the Divine throne. And
perhaps for this reason the effort of the dramatist comes
short of the occasion.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that attention is fixed on isolated
expressions which fell from Job's lips, that there is no
endeavour to set forth fully the attitude of the sufferer
towards the Almighty. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar
had made Job an offender for a word and Elihu follows
them. We anticipate that his criticism, however telling
it may be, will miss the true point, the heart of the
question. He will possibly establish some things
against Job, but they will not prove him to have
failed as a brave seeker after truth and God.</p>

<p>Opposing the claim and complaint he has quoted,
Elihu advances in the first instance a proposition
which has the air of a truism&mdash;"<i>God is greater than
man.</i>" He does not try to prove that even though a
man has appeared to himself righteous he may really
be sinful in the sight of the Almighty, or that God has
the right to afflict an innocent person in order to bring
about some great and holy design. The contention is
that a man should suffer and be silent. God is not to
be questioned; His providence is not to be challenged.
A man, however he may have lived, is not to doubt
that there is good reason for his misery if he is miserable.
He is to let stroke after stroke fall and utter no
complaint. And yet Job had erred in saying, "<i>God
giveth not account of any of His matters.</i>" It is not
true, says Elihu, that the Divine King holds Himself
entirely aloof from the inquiries and prayers of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
subjects. He discloses in more than one way both His
purposes and His grace.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Why dost thou contend against God</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That He giveth not account of any of His matters?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For God speaketh once, yea twice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet man perceiveth it not.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first way in which, according to Elihu, God speaks
to men is by a dream, a vision of the night; and the
second way is by the chastisement of pain.</p>

<p>Now as to the first of these, the dream or vision,
Elihu had, of course, the testimony of almost universal
belief, and also of some cases that passed ordinary
experience. Scriptural examples, such as the dreams
of Jacob, of Joseph, of Pharaoh, and the prophetic
visions already recognised by all pious Hebrews, were
no doubt in the writer's mind. Yet if it is implied that
Job might have learned the will of God from dreams,
or that this was a method of Divine communication for
which any man might look, the rule laid down was at
least perilous. Visions are not always from God. A
dream may come "by the multitude of business." It
is true, as Elihu says, that one who is bent on some
proud and dangerous course may be more himself in a
dream than in his waking hours. He may see a picture
of the future which scares him, and so he may be
deterred from his purpose. Yet the waking thoughts
of a man, if he is sincere and conscientious, are far
more fitted to guide him, as a rule, than his dreams.</p>

<p>Passing to the second method of Divine communication,
Elihu appears to be on safer ground. He describes
the case of an afflicted man brought to extremity by
disease, whose soul draweth near to the grave and his
life to the destroyers or death-angels. Such suffering
and weakness do not of themselves insure knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
of God's will, but they prepare the sufferer to be instructed.
And for his deliverance an interpreter is
required.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If there be with him an angel,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>An interpreter, one among a thousand,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To show unto man what is his duty;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then He is gracious unto him and saith,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Deliver him from going down to the pit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I have found a ransom.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elihu cannot say that such an angel or interpreter
will certainly appear. He may: and if he does and
points the way of uprightness, and that way is followed,
then the result is redemption, deliverance, renewed
prosperity. But who is this angel? "One of the
ministering spirits sent forth to do service on behalf of
the heirs of salvation?" The explanation is somewhat
far-fetched. The ministering angels were not restricted
in number. Each Hebrew was supposed to have two
such guardians. Then Malachi says, "The priest's lips
should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law
at his mouth; for he is the angel (messenger) of Jehovah
Sebaoth." Here the priest appears as an angel-interpreter,
and the passage seems to throw light on Elihu's
meaning. As no explicit mention is made of a priest
or any priestly function in our text, it may at least be
hinted that interpreters of the law, scribes or incipient
rabbis are intended, of whom Elihu claims to be one.
In this case the ransom would remain without explanation.
But if we take that as a sacrificial offering, the
name "angel-interpreter" covers a reference to the
properly accredited priest. The passage is so obscure
that little can be based upon it; yet assuming the Elihu
discourses to be of late origin and intended to bring
the poem into line with orthodox Hebrew thought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
introduction of either priest or scribe would be in
harmony with such a purpose. Mediation at all events
is declared to be necessary as between the sufferer and
God; and it would be strange indeed if Elihu, professing
to explain matters, really made Divine grace
to be consequent on the intervention of an angel
whose presence and instruction could in no way be
verified. Elihu is realistic and would not rest his
case at any point on what might be declared purely
imaginary.</p>

<p>The promise he virtually makes to Job is like those
of Eliphaz and the others,&mdash;renewed health, restored
youth, the sense of Divine favour. Enjoying these, the
forgiven penitent sings before men, acknowledging
his fault and praising God for his redemption. The
assurance of deliverance was probably made in view of
the epilogue, with Job's confession and the prosperity
restored to him. But the writer misunderstands the
confession, and promises too glibly. It is good to
receive after great affliction the guidance of a wise
interpreter; and to seek God again in humility is
certainly a man's duty. But would submission and
the forgiveness of God bring results in the physical
sphere, health, renewed youth and felicity? No invariable
nexus of cause and effect can be established
here from experience of the dealings of God with men.
Elihu's account of the way in which the Almighty
communicates with His creatures must be declared a
failure. It is in some respects careful and ingenious,
yet it has no sufficient ground of evidence. When
he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Lo, all these things worketh God</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Oftentimes with man,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To bring back his soul from the pit</i>"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></div></div>

<p>the design is pious, but the great question of the book
is not touched. The righteous suffer like the wicked
from disease, bereavement, disappointment, anxiety.
Even when their integrity is vindicated the lost years
and early vigour are not restored. It is useless to deal
in the way of pure fancy with the troubles of existence.
We say to Elihu and all his school, Let us be at the
truth, let us know the absolute reality. There are
valleys of human sorrow, suffering, and trial in which
the shadows grow deeper as the traveller presses on,
where the best are often most afflicted. We need
another interpreter than Elihu, one who suffers like us
and is made perfect by suffering, through it entering
into His glory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An invocation addressed by Elihu to the bystanders
begins chap. xxxiv. Again he emphatically asserts his
right to speak, his claim to be a guide of those who
think on the ways of God. He appeals to sound reason
and he takes his auditors into counsel&mdash;"<i>Let us choose
to ourselves judgment; let us know among ourselves what
is good.</i>" The proposal is that there shall be conference
on the subject of Job's claim. But Elihu alone speaks.
It is he who selects "what is good."</p>

<p>Certain words that fell from the lips of Job are again
his text. Job hath said, I am righteous, I am in the
right; and, God hath taken away my judgment or
vindication. When those words were used the meaning
of Job was that the circumstances in which he had
been placed, the troubles appointed by God seemed to
prove him a transgressor. But was he to rest under
a charge he knew to be untrue? Stricken with an
incurable wound though he had not transgressed, was
he to be against his right by remaining silent? This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
says Elihu, is Job's unfounded impious indictment of
the Almighty; and he asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>What man is like Job,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who drinketh up impiety like water,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And walketh with wicked men?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Job had spoken of his right which God had taken
away. What was his right? Was he, as he affirmed,
without transgression? On the contrary, his principles
were irreligious. There was infidelity beneath his
apparent piety. Elihu will prove that so far from
being clear of blame he has been imbibing wrong
opinions and joining the company of the wicked. This
attack shows the temper of the writer. No doubt
certain expressions put into the mouth of Job by the
original dramatist might be taken as impeaching the
goodness or the justice of God. But to assert that
even the most unguarded passages of the book made
for impiety was a great mistake. Faith in God is to
be traced not obscurely but as a shaft of light through
all the speeches put into the mouth of his hero by the
poet. One whose mind is bound by certain pious
forms of thought may fail to see the light, but it shines
nevertheless.</p>

<p>The attempt made by Elihu to establish his charge
has an appearance of success. Job, he says, is one
who drinks up impiety like water and walks with
wicked men,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That he should delight himself with God.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If this were true, Job would indeed be proved irreligious.
Such a statement strikes at the root of faith and
obedience. But is Elihu representing the text with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
anything like precision? In chap. ix. 22 these words
are put into Job's mouth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>It is all one, therefore I say,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>God is strong and is breaking him with a tempest.
Job finds it useless to defend himself and maintain that
he is perfect. In the midst of the storm he is so tossed
that he despises his life; and in perplexity he cries,&mdash;It
is all one whether I am righteous or not, God
destroys the good and the vile alike. Again we find
him saying, "Wherefore do the wicked live, become old,
yea, are mighty in power?" And in another passage
he inquires why the Almighty does not appoint days
of judgment. These are the expressions on which
Elihu founds his charge, but the precise words attributed
to Job were never used by him, and in many places he
both said and implied that the favour of God was his
greatest joy. The second author is either misapprehending
or perverting the language of his predecessor.
His argument accordingly does not succeed.</p>

<p>Passing at present from the charge of impiety, Elihu
takes up the suggestion that Divine providence is unjust
and sets himself to show that, whether men delight
themselves in the Almighty or not, He is certainly
All-righteous. And in this contention, so long as he
keeps to generalities and does not take special account
of the case which has roused the whole controversy,
he speaks with some power. His argument comes
properly to this, If you ascribe injustice or partiality
to Him whom you call God, you cannot be thinking of
the Divine King. From His very nature and from His
position as Lord of all, God cannot be unjust. As
Maker and Preserver of life He must be faithful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Far be from God a wickedness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>From the Almighty an injustice!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For every one's work He requiteth him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And causeth each to find according to his ways.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Surely, too, God doeth not wickedness,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The Almighty perverteth not justice.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Has God any motive for being unjust? Can any
one urge Him to what is against His nature? The
thing is impossible. So far Elihu has all with him,
for all alike believe in the sovereignty of God. The
Most High, responsible to Himself, must be conceived
of as perfectly just. But would He be so if He were
to destroy the whole of His creatures? Elihu says,
God's sovereignty over all gives Him the right to act
according to His will; and His will determines not
only what is, but what is right in every case.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Who hath given Him a charge over the earth?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or who hath disposed the whole world?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Were He to set His mind upon Himself,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To gather to Himself His spirit and His breath,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then all flesh would die together,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Man would return to his dust.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The life of all creatures implies that the mind of the
Creator goes forth to His universe, to rule it, to supply
the needs of all living beings. He is not wrapped up
in Himself, but having given life He provides for its
maintenance.</p>

<p>Another personal appeal in verse 16 is meant to
secure attention to what follows, in which the idea is
carried out that the Creator must rule His creatures by
a law of justice.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Shall one that hateth right be able to control?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or wilt thou condemn the Just, the Mighty One?</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Is it fit to say to a king, Thou wicked?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or to princes, Ye ungodly?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>How much less to Him who accepts not the persons of princes,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the principle is good, the argument or illustration
inconclusive. There is a strong foundation in the
thought that God, who could if He desired withdraw
all life, but on the other hand sustains it, must rule
according to a law of perfect righteousness. If this
principle were kept in the front and followed up we
should have a fruitful argument. But the philosophy
of it is beyond this thinker, and he weakens his case by
pointing to human rulers and arguing from the duty of
subjects to abide by their decision and at least attribute
to them the virtue of justice. No doubt society must
be held together by a head either hereditary or chosen
by the people, and, so long as his rule is necessary to
the well-being of the realm, what he commands must
be obeyed and what he does must be approved as if
it were right. But the writer either had an exceptionally
favourable experience of kings, as one, let us
suppose, honoured like Daniel in the Babylonian exile,
or his faith in the Divine right of princes blinded him
to much injustice. It is a mark of his defective logic
that he rests his case for the perfect righteousness
of God upon a sentiment or what may be called
an accident.</p>

<p>And when Elihu proceeds, it is with some rambling
sentences in which the suddenness of death, the insecurity
of human things, and the trouble and distress
coming now on whole nations now on workers of
iniquity are all thrown together for the demonstration
of Divine justice. We hear in these verses (20 to 28)
the echoes of disaster and exile, of the fall of thrones
and empires. Because the afflicted tribes of Judah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
were preserved in captivity and restored to their own
land, the history of the period which is before the
writer's mind appears to him to supply a conclusive
proof of the righteousness of the Almighty. But we
fail to see it. Eliphaz and Bildad might have spoken
in the same terms as Elihu uses here. Everything is
assumed that Job by force of circumstance has been
compelled to doubt. The whole is a homily on God's
irresponsible power and penetrating wisdom which, it
is taken for granted, must be exercised in righteousness.
Where proof is needed nothing but assertion is offered.
It is easy to say that when a man is struck down in the
open sight of others it is because he has been cruel to
the poor and the Almighty has been moved by the cry
of the afflicted. But here is Job struck down in the
open sight of others; and is it for harshness to the
poor? If Elihu does not mean that, what does he
mean? The conclusion is the same as that reached
by the three friends; and this speaker poses, like the
rest, as a generous man declaring that the iniquity God
is always sure to punish is tyrannical treatment of the
orphan and the widow.</p>

<p>Leaving this unfortunate attempt at reasoning we
enter at verse 31 on a passage in which the circumstances
of Job are directly dealt with.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>For hath any one spoken thus unto God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>'I have suffered though I offend not:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That which I see not teach Thou;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If I have done iniquity I will do it no more'?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Shall God's recompense be according to thy mind</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That thou dost reject it?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For thou must choose, and not I:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Therefore speak what thou knowest.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the argument seems to be that a man like Job,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
assuming himself to be innocent, if he bows down
before the sovereign Judge, confesses ignorance, and
even goes so far as to acknowledge that he may have
sinned unwittingly and promises amendment, such a
one has no right to dictate to God or to complain if
suffering and trouble continue. God may afflict as long
as He pleases without showing why He afflicts. And if
the sufferer dares to complain he does so at his own
peril. Elihu would not be the man to complain in such
a case. He would suffer on silently. But the choice
is for Job to make; and he has need to consider well
before he comes to a decision. Elihu implies that as yet
Job is in the wrong mind, and he closes this part of his
address in a sort of brutal triumph over the sufferer
because he had complained of his sufferings. He puts
the condemnation into the mouth of "men of understanding";
but it is his own.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Men of understanding will say to me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the wise who hears me will say:&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Job speaks without intelligence,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And his words are without wisdom:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Would that Job were tried unto the end</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For his answers after the manner of wicked men.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For he addeth rebellion to his sin;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He clappeth his hands amongst us</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And multiplieth his words against God.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ideas of Elihu are few and fixed. When his
attempts to convince betray his weakness in argument,
he falls back on the vulgar expedient of brow-beating
the defendant. He is a type of many would-be
interpreters of Divine providence, forcing a theory of
religion which admirably fits those who reckon themselves

many lives that are all along under a cloud of trouble
and grief. The religious creed which alone can satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
is one throwing light adown the darkest ravines human
beings have to thread, in ignorance of God which they
cannot help, in pain of body and feebleness of mind not
caused by their own sin but by the sins of others, in
slavery or something worse than slavery.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE DIVINE PREROGATIVE.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Chaps.</span> xxxv.-xxxvii.</p>


<p>After a long digression Elihu returns to consider
the statement ascribed to Job, "It profiteth a
man nothing that he should delight himself with God"
(chap. xxxiv. 9). This he laid hold of as meaning
that the Almighty is unjust, and the accusation has
been dealt with. Now he resumes the question of the
profitableness of religion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thinkest thou this to be in thy right,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And callest thou it 'My just cause before God,'</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That thou dost ask what advantage it is to thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And 'What profit have I more than if I had sinned'?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In one of his replies Job, speaking of the wicked,
represented them as saying, "What is the Almighty
that we should serve Him? and what profit should we
have if we pray unto Him?" (chap. xxi. 15). He
added then, "The counsel of the wicked be far from
me." Job is now declared to be of the same opinion as
the wicked whom he condemned. The man who again
and again appealed to God from the judgment of his
friends, who found consolation in the thought that his
witness was in heaven, who, when he was scorned,
sought God in tears and hoped against hope for His
redemption, is charged with holding faith and religion
of no advantage. Is it in misapprehension or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
design the charge is made? Job did indeed occasionally
seem to deny the profit of religion, but only when
the false theology of his friends drove him to false
judgment. His real conviction was right. Once
Eliphaz pressed the same accusation and lost his way
in trying to prove it. Elihu has no fresh evidence, and
he too falls into error. He confounds the original
charge against Job with another, and makes an offence
of that which the whole scope of the poem and our
sense of right completely justify.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Look unto the heavens and see,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And regard the clouds which are higher than thou.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against Him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or what receiveth He at thy hands?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Elihu is actually proving, not that Job expects too little
from religion and finds no profit in it, but that he
expects too much. Anxious to convict, he will show
that man has no right to make his faith depend on
God's care for his integrity. The prologue showed
the Almighty pleased with His servant's faithfulness.
That, says Elihu, is a mistake.</p>

<p>Consider the clouds and the heavens which are far
above the world. Thou canst not touch them, affect
them. The sun and moon and stars shine with undiminished
brightness however vile men may be. The
clouds come and go quite independently of the crimes of
men. God is above those clouds, above that firmament.
Neither can the evil hands of men reach His throne,
nor the righteousness of men enhance His glory. It is
precisely what we heard from the lips of Eliphaz (chap.
xxii. 2-4), an argument which abuses man for the sake
of exalting God. Elihu has no thought of the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
relationship between man and his Creator. He advances
with perfect composure as a hard dogma what Job said
in the bitterness of his soul.</p>

<p>If, however, the question must still be answered,
What good end is served by human virtue? the reply
is,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>God sustains the righteous and punishes the wicked,
not for the sake of righteousness itself but purely for
the sake of men. The law is that of expediency. Let
not man dream of witnessing for God, or upholding any
eternal principle dear to God. Let him confine religious
fidelity and aspiration to their true sphere, the service
of mankind. Regarding which doctrine we may simply
say that, if religion is profitable in this way only, it may
as well be frankly given up and the cult of happiness
adopted for it everywhere. But Elihu is not true to his
own dogma.</p>

<p>The next passage, beginning with verse 9, seems to
be an indictment of those who in grievous trouble do
not see and acknowledge the Divine blessings which
are the compensations of their lot. Many in the world
are sorely oppressed. Elihu has heard their piteous
cries. But he has this charge against them, that they
do not realise what it is to be subjects of the heavenly
King.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>By reason of the multitude of oppressions men cry out,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But none saith, Where is God my Maker,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who giveth songs in the night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>There they cry because of the pride of evil men;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But none giveth answer.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></div></div>

<p>These cries of the oppressed are complaints against
pain, natural outbursts of feeling, like the moans of
wounded animals. But those who are cruelly wronged
may turn to God and endeavour to realise their position
as intelligent creatures of His who should feel after
Him and find Him. If they do so, then hope will
mingle with their sorrow and light arise on their
darkness. For in the deepest midnight God's presence
cheers the soul and tunes the voice to songs of praise.
The intention is to show that when prayer seems of
no avail and religion does not help, it is because there
is no real faith, no right apprehension by men of their
relation to God. Elihu, however, fails to see that if
the righteousness of men is not important to God as
righteousness, much less will He be interested in their
grievances. The bond of union between the heavenly
and the earthly is broken; and it cannot be restored
by showing that the grief of men touches God more
than their sin. Job's distinction is that he clings to
the ethical fellowship between a sincere man and his
Maker and to the claim and the hope involved in that
relationship. There we have the jewel in the lotus-flower
of this book, as in all true and noble literature.
Elihu, like the rest, is far beneath Job. If he can be
said to have a glimmering of the idea it is only that he
may oppose it. This moral affinity with God as the
principle of human life remains the secret of the inspired
author; it lifts him above the finest minds of the Gentile
world. The compiler of the Elihu portion, although
he has the admirable sentiment that God giveth songs
in the night, has missed the great and elevating
truth which fills with prophetic force the original
poem.</p>

<p>From verse 14 onward to the close of the chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the argument is turned directly against Job, but is so
obscure that the meaning can only be conjectured.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Surely God will not hear vanity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Neither will the Almighty regard it.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If any one cries out against suffering as an animal in
pain might cry, that is vanity, not merely emptiness
but impiety, and God will not hear nor regard such a
cry. Elihu means that Job's complaints were essentially
of this nature. True, he had called on God; that
cannot be denied. He had laid his case before the
Judge and professed to expect vindication. But he
was at fault in that very appeal, for it was still of
suffering he complained, and he was still impious.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Even when thou sayest that thou seest Him not,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That thy cause is before Him and thou waitest for Him;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Even then because His anger visiteth not,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And He doth not strictly regard transgression,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He multiplied words without knowledge.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The argument seems to be: God rules in absolute
supremacy, and His will is not to be questioned; it
may not be demanded of Him that He do this or
that. What is a man that he should dare to state any
"righteous cause" of his before God and claim justification?
Let Job understand that the Almighty has
been showing leniency, holding back His hand. He
might kill any man outright and there would be no
appeal nor ground of complaint. It is because He
does not strictly regard iniquity that Job is still alive.
Therefore appeals and hopes are offensive to God.</p>

<p>The insistence of this part of the book reaches a
climax here and becomes repulsive. Elihu's opinions
oscillate we may say between Deism and Positivism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and on either side he is a special pleader. It is by the
mercy of the Almighty all men live; yet the reasoning
of Elihu makes mercy so remote and arbitrary that
prayer becomes an impertinence. No doubt there are
some cries out of trouble which cannot find response.
But he ought to maintain, on the other hand, that
if sincere prayer is addressed to God by one in
sore affliction desiring to know wherein he has
sinned and imploring deliverance, that appeal shall be
heard. This, however, is denied. For the purpose of
convicting Job Elihu takes the singular position that
though there is mercy with God man is neither to
expect nor ask it, that to make any claim upon Divine
grace is impious. And there is no promise that suffering
will bring spiritual gain. God has a right to afflict
His creatures, and what He does is to be endured
without a murmur because it is less than He has the
right to appoint. The doctrine is adamantine and at
the same time rent asunder by the error which is
common to all Job's opponents. The soul of a man
resolutely faithful like Job would turn away from it
with righteous contempt and indignation. The light
which Elihu professes to enjoy is a midnight of dogmatic
darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Passing to chap. xxxvi. we are still among vague
surmisings which appear the more inconsequent that
the speaker makes a large claim of knowledge.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Suffer me a little and I will show thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I have somewhat yet to say on God's behalf.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I will fetch my knowledge from afar,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For truly my words are not false:</i><br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Elihu is zealous for the honour of that great Being
whom he adores because from Him he has received
life and light and power. He is sure of what he says,
and proceeds with a firm step. Preparation thus made,
the vindication of God follows&mdash;a series of sayings
which draw to something useful only when the doctrine
becomes hopelessly inconsistent with what has already
been laid down.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold God is mighty and despiseth not any;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He is mighty in strength of understanding.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He preserveth not the life of the wicked,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But giveth right to the poor.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But, with kings on the throne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He setteth them up for ever, and they are exalted.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And if they be bound in fetters,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If they be held in cords of affliction,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then He showeth them their work</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And their transgressions, that they have acted proudly,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He openeth their ear to discipline</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"God despiseth not any"&mdash;this appears to have something
of the humane breadth hitherto wanting in the
discourses of Elihu. He does not mean, however, that
the Almighty estimates every life without contempt,
counting the feeblest and most sinful as His creatures;
but that He passes over none in the administration
of His justice. Illustrations of the doctrine as Elihu
intends it to be received are supplied in the couplet,
"He preserveth not the life of the wicked, but giveth
right to the poor." The poor are helped, the wicked
are given up to death. As for the righteous, two very
different methods of dealing with them are described.
For Elihu himself, and others favoured with prosperity,
the law of the Divine order has been, "With kings on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the throne God setteth them up for ever." A personal
consciousness of merit leading to honourable rank in
the state seems at variance with the hard dogma of the
evil desert of all men. But the rabbi has his own
position to fortify. The alternative, however, could
not be kept out of sight, since the misery of exile was
a vivid recollection, if not an actual experience, with
many reputable men who were bound in fetters and
held by cords of affliction. It is implied that, though
of good character, these are not equal in righteousness
to the favourites of kings. Some errors require correction;
and these men are cast into trouble, that they
may learn to renounce pride and turn from iniquity.
Elihu preaches the benefits of chastening, and in
touching on pride he comes near the case of Job. But
the argument is rude and indiscriminative. To admit
that a man is righteous and then speak of his transgressions
and iniquity, must mean that he is really
far beneath his reputation or the estimate he has
formed of himself.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see precisely what Elihu considers
the proper frame of mind which God will reward.
There must be humility, obedience, submission to discipline,
renunciation of past errors. But we remember
the doctrine that a man's righteousness cannot profit
God, can only profit his fellow-men. Does Elihu, then,
make submission to the powers that be almost the
same thing as religion? His reference to high position
beside the throne is to a certain extent suggestive of this.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If they obey and serve God,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They shall spend their days in prosperity</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And their years in pleasures.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But if they obey not</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They shall perish by the sword,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And they shall die without knowledge.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Elihu thinks over much of kings and exaltation beside
them and of years of prosperity and pleasure, and
his own view of human character and merit follows
the judgment of those who have honours to bestow
and love the servile pliant mind.</p>

<p>In the dark hours of sorrow and pain, says Elihu,
men have the choice to begin life anew in lowly obedience
or else to harden their hearts against the providence
of God. Instruction has been offered, and they
must either embrace it or trample it under foot. And
passing to the case of Job, who, it is plain, is afflicted
because he needs chastisement, not having attained
to Elihu's perfectness in the art of life, the speaker
cautiously offers a promise and gives an emphatic
warning.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He delivereth the afflicted by his affliction</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And openeth their ear in oppression.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yea, He would allure thee out of the mouth of thy distress</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Into a broad place where is no straitness;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And that which is set on thy table shall be full of fatness.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>But if thou art full of the judgment of the wicked,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Judgment and justice shall keep hold on thee.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For beware lest wrath lead thee away to mockery,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And let not the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Will thy riches suffice that are without stint?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or all the forces of thy strength?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Choose not that night,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When the peoples are cut off in their place:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Take heed thou turn not to iniquity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For this thou hast chosen rather than affliction.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A side reference here shows that the original writer
dealing with his hero has been replaced by another
who does not realise the circumstances of Job with
the same dramatic skill. His appeal is forcible, however,
in its place. There was danger that one long
and grievously afflicted might be led away by wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
and turn to mockery or scornfulness, so forfeiting the
possibility of redemption. Job might also say in
bitterness of soul that he had paid a great price to
God in losing all his riches. The warning has point,
although Job never betrayed the least disposition to
think the loss of property a ransom exacted of him by
God. Elihu's suggestion to this effect is by no means
evangelical; it springs from a worldly conception of
what is valuable to man and of great account with the
Almighty. Observe, however, the reminiscences of
national disaster. The picture of the night of a people's
calamity had force for Elihu's generation, but here it
is singularly inappropriate. Job's night had come to
himself alone. If his afflictions had been shared by
others, a different complexion would have been given
to them. The final thrust, that the sufferer had chosen
iniquity rather than profitable chastisement, has no
point whatsoever.</p>

<p>The section closes with a strophe (vv. 22-25) which,
calling for submission to the Divine ordinance and
praise of the doings of the Almighty, forms a transition
to the main theme of the address.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chap. xxxvi. 26&mdash;xxxvii. 24. There need be little
hesitation in regarding this passage as an ode supplied
to the second writer or simply quoted by him for the
purpose of giving strength to his argument. Scarcely
a single note in the portion of Elihu's address already
considered approaches the poetical art of this. The
glory of God in His creation and His unsearchable
wisdom are illustrated from the phenomena of the
heavens without reference to the previous sections of
the address. One who was more a poet than a reasoner
might indeed halt and stumble as the speaker has done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
up to this point and find liberty when he reached a theme
congenial to his mind. But there are points at which
we seem to hear the voice of Elihu interrupting the flow
of the ode as no poet would check his muse. At chap,
xxxvii. 14 the sentence is interjected, like an aside of
the writer drawing attention to the words he is quoting,&mdash;"<i>Hearken
unto this, O Job; stand still and consider the
wondrous works of God.</i>" Again (vv. 19, 20), between
the description of the burnished mirror of the sky and
that of the clearness after the sweeping wind, without
any reference to the train of thought, the ejaculation is
introduced,&mdash;"<i>Teach us what we shall say unto Him, for
we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. Shall
it be told Him that I speak? If a man speak surely he
shall be swallowed up.</i>" The final verses also seem to
be in the manner of Elihu.</p>

<p>But the ode as a whole, though it has the fault of
endeavouring to forestall what is put into the mouth of
the Almighty speaking from the storm, is one of the
fine passages of the book. We pass from "cold, heavy
and pretentious" dogmatic discussions to free and
striking pictures of nature, with the feeling that one
is guiding us who can present in eloquent language
the fruits of his study of the works of God. The
descriptions have been noted for their felicity and
power by such observers as Baron Humboldt and Mr.
Ruskin. While the point of view is that invariably
taken by Hebrew writers, the originality of the ode
lies in fresh observation and record of atmospheric
phenomena, especially of the rain and snow, rolling
clouds, thunderstorms and winds. The pictures do
not seem to belong to the Arabian desert but to a fertile
peopled region like Aram or the Chaldæan plain. Upon
the fields and dwellings of men, not on wide expanses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of barren sand, the rains and snows fall, and they seal
up the hand of man. The lightning clouds cover the
face of the "habitable world"; by them God judgeth the
peoples.</p>

<p>In the opening verses the theme of the ode is set
forth&mdash;the greatness of God, the vast duration of His
being, transcending human knowledge.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Behold God is great and we know Him not,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The number of His years is unsearchable.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To estimate His majesty or fathom the depths of His
eternal will is far beyond us who are creatures of a day.
Yet we may have some vision of His power. Look up
when rain is falling, mark how the clouds that float
above distil the drops of water and pour down great
floods upon the earth. Mark also how the dark cloud
spreading from the horizon obscures the blue expanse
of the sky. We cannot understand; but we can realise
to some extent the majesty of Him whose is the light
and the darkness, who is heard in the thunder-peal and
seen in the forked lightning.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The crashings of His pavilion?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Behold He spreadeth His light about Him;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And covereth it with the depths of the sea.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For by these judgeth He the peoples;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He giveth meat in abundance.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Translating from the Vulgate the two following verses,
Mr. Ruskin gives the meaning, "He hath hidden the
light in His hands and commanded it that it should
return. He speaks of it to His friend; that it is His
possession, and that he may ascend thereto." The
rendering cannot be received, yet the comment may be
cited. "These rain-clouds are the robes of love of
the Angel of the Sea. To these that name is chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
given, the 'spreadings of the clouds,' from their extent,
their gentleness, their fulness of rain." And this is
"the meaning of those strange golden lights and purple
flushes before the morning rain. The rain is sent to
judge and feed us; but the light is the possession of
the friends of God, that they may ascend thereto,&mdash;where
the tabernacle veil will cross and part its rays
no more."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The real import does not reach this spiritual height.
It is simply that the tremendous thunder brings to
transgressors the terror of judgment, and the copious
showers that follow water the parched earth for the
sake of man. Of the justice and grace of God we are
made aware when His angel spreads his wings over the
world. In the darkened sky there is a crash as if the
vast canopy of the firmament were torn asunder. And
now a keen flash lights the gloom for a moment; anon
it is swallowed up as if the inverted sea, poured in
cataracts upon the flame, extinguished it. Men recognise
the Divine indignation, and even the lower animals
seem to be aware.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>He covereth His hands with the lightning,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He giveth it a charge against the adversary.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Its thunder telleth concerning Him,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Even the cattle concerning that which cometh up.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Continued in the thirty-seventh chapter, the description
appears to be from what is actually going on, a
tremendous thunderstorm that shakes the earth. The
sound comes, as it were, out of the mouth of God,
reverberating from sky to earth and from earth to sky,
and rolling away under the whole heaven. Again there
are lightnings, and "<i>He stayeth them not when His voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
is heard.</i>" Swift ministers of judgment and death they
are darted upon the world.</p>

<p>We are asked to consider a fresh wonder, that of
the snow which at certain times replaces the gentle or
copious rain. The cold fierce showers of winter arrest
the labour of man, and even the wild beasts seek their
dens and abide in their lurking-places. "The Angel
of the Sea," says Mr. Ruskin, "has also another message,&mdash;in
the 'great rain of His strength,' rain of trial,
sweeping away ill-set foundations. Then his robe is
not spread softly over the whole heaven as a veil, but
sweeps back from his shoulders, ponderous, oblique,
terrible&mdash;leaving his sword-arm free." God is still
directly at work. "<i>Out of His chamber cometh the
storm and cold out of the north.</i>" His breath gives the
frost and straitens the breadth of waters. Towards
Armenia, perhaps, the poet has seen the rivers and lakes
frozen from bank to bank. Our science explains the
result of diminished temperature; we know under what
conditions hoar-frost is deposited and how hail is
formed. Yet all we can say is that thus and thus the
forces act. Beyond that we remain like this writer,
awed in presence of a heavenly Will which determines
the course and appoints the marvels of nature.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>By the breath of God ice is given,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And the breadth of the waters is straitened.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Also He ladeth the thick cloud with moisture,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He spreadeth His lightning cloud abroad;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And it is turned about by His guidance,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That it may do whatsoever He commandeth</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Upon the face of the whole earth.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, again, moral purpose is found. The poet
attributes to others his own susceptibility. Men see
and learn and tremble. It is for correction, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
careless may be brought to think of God's greatness,
and the evil-doers of His power, that sinners being
made afraid may turn from their rebellion. Or, it is
for His earth, that rain may beautify it and fill the
rivers and springs at which the beasts of the valley
drink. Or, yet again, the purpose is mercy. Even
the tremendous thunderstorm may be fraught with
mercy to men. From the burning heat, oppressive,
intolerable, the rains that follow bring deliverance.
Men are fainting for thirst, the fields are languishing.
In compassion God sends His great cloud on its mission
of life.</p>

<p>More delicate, needing finer observation, are the next
objects of study.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Dost thou know how God layeth His charge on them,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And causeth the light of His cloud to shine?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>The wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not clear whether the light of the cloud means
the lightning again or the varied hues which make an
Oriental sunset glorious in purple and gold. But the
balancings of the clouds must be that singular power
which the atmosphere has of sustaining vast quantities
of watery vapour&mdash;either miles above the earth's surface
where the filmy cirrhus floats, dazzling white against
the blue sky, or lower down where the rain-cloud trails
along the hill-tops. Marvellous it is that, suspended
thus in the air, immense volumes of water should be
carried from the surface of the ocean to be discharged
in fructifying rain.</p>

<p>Then again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>How are thy garments warm</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When the earth is still because of the south wind?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sensation of dry hot clothing is said to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
notable in the season of the siroccos or south winds,
also the extraordinary stillness of nature under the
same oppressive influence. "There is no living thing
abroad to make a noise. The air is too weak and
languid to stir the pendant leaves even of the tall
poplars."</p>

<p>Finally the vast expanse of the sky, like a looking-glass
of burnished metal stretched far over sea and
land, symbolises the immensity of Divine power.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Canst thou with Him spread out the sky</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Which is strong as a molten mirror?...</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Yet the wind passeth and cleanseth them.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is always bright beyond. Clouds only hide the
splendid sunshine for a time. A wind rises and sweeps
away the vapours from the glorious dome of heaven.
"<i>Out of the north cometh golden splendour</i>"&mdash;for it is
the north wind that drives on the clouds which, as they
fly southward, are gilded by the rays of the sun. But
with God is a splendour greater far, that of terrible
majesty.</p>

<p>So the ode finishes abruptly, and Elihu states his
own conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The Almighty! we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And in judgment and plenteous justice; He will not afflict.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Men do therefore fear Him;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is Job wise in his own conceit? Does he think he can
challenge the Divine government and show how the
affairs of the world might have been better ordered?
Does he think that he is himself treated unjustly because
loss and disease have been appointed to him?
Right thoughts of God will check all such ignorant
notions and bring him a penitent back to the throne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
of the Eternal. It is a good and wise deduction; but
Elihu has not vindicated God by showing in harmony
with the noblest and finest ideas of righteousness men
have, God supremely righteous, and beyond the best
and noblest mercy men love, God transcendently
merciful and gracious. In effect his argument has
been&mdash;The Almighty must be all-righteous, and any
one is impious who criticises life. The whole question
between Job and the friends remains unsettled still.</p>

<p>Elihu's failure is significant. It is the failure of an
attempt made, as we have seen, centuries after the
Book of Job was written, to bring it into the line of
current religious opinion. Our examination of the whole
reveals the narrow foundation on which Hebrew orthodoxy
was reared and explains the developments of a
later time. Job may be said to have left no disciples
in Israel. His brave personal hope and passionate
desire for union with God seem to have been lost in
the fervid national bigotry of post-exilic ages; and
while they faded, the Pharisee and Sadducee of after
days began to exist. They are both here in germ.
Springing from one seed, they are alike in their ignorance
of Divine justice; and we do not wonder that
Christ, coming to fulfil and more than fulfil the hope of
humanity, appeared to both the Pharisee and Sadducee
of His time as an enemy of religion, of the country, and
of God.</p>

<p>Over the shadowed life of Job, and the world
shadowed for him by his own intellectual and
moral gloom, a storm sweeps, and from the storm issues
a voice. With the symbol of vast Divine energy comes
an answer to the problem of tried and troubled human
life. It has seemed, as time went by, that the appeals
of the sufferer were unheard, that the rigid silence of
heaven would never break. But had he not heard?
"Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their
words to the end of the world." Job should have
known. What is given will be a fresh presentation of
ideas now to be seen in their strength and bearing
because the mind is prepared and made eager. The
man, brought to the edge of pessimism, will at last look
abroad and follow the doings of the Almighty even
through storm and darkness. Does the sublime voice
issue only to overbear and reduce him to silence? Not
so. His reason is addressed, his thought demanded,
his power to recognise truth is called for. A great
demonstration is made, requiring at every step the
response of mind and heart. The Creator reveals His
care for the creation, for the race of men, for every
kind of being and every need. He declares His own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
glory, of transcendent power, of immeasurable wisdom,
also of righteous and holy will. He can afflict men,
and yet do them no wrong but good, for they are His
men, for whom He provides as they cannot provide for
themselves. Trial, sorrow, change, death&mdash;is anything
"disastrous" that God ordains? Impossible. His
care of His creation is beyond our imagining. There
are no disasters in His universe unless where the will
of man divorced from faith would tear a way for itself
through the fastnesses of His eternal law.</p>

<p>Eloah is known through the tempest as well as in
the dewdrop and the tender blossom. What is capable
of strength must be made strong. That is the Divine
law throughout all life, for the cedar on Lebanon, the
ox in the yoke, the lion of the Libyan desert. Chiefly
the moral nature of man must find its strength. The
glory of God is to have sons who can endure. The
easy piety of a happy race, living among flowers and
offering incense for adoration, cannot satisfy Him of
the eternal will, the eternal power. Men must learn to
trust, to endure, to hold themselves undismayed when
the fury of tempest scours their world and heaps the
driven snow above their dwellings and death comes
cold and stark. Struggle man shall, struggle on
through strange and dreadful trials till he learn to live
in the thought of Divine Will and Love, co-ordinate in
one Lord true to Himself, worthy to be trusted through
all cloud and clash. Ever is He pursuing an end conformable
to the nature of the beings He has created,
and, with man an end conformable to his nature, the
possibilities of endless moral development, the widening
movements of increasing life. Let man know this and
submit, know this and rejoice. A dream-life shall be
impossible to man, use his day as he will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Is this Divine utterance from the storm required by
the progress of the drama? Some have doubted
whether its tenor is consistent with the previous line
of thought; yet the whole movement sets distinctly
towards it, could terminate in no other way. The
prologue, affirming God's satisfaction with His servant,
left us assured that if Job remained pure and kept his
faith his name would not be blotted from the book
of life. He has kept his integrity; no falsehood or
baseness can be charged against him. But is he still
with God in sincere and humble faith? We have
heard him accuse the Most High of cruel enmity. At
the close he lies under the suspicion of impious daring
and revolt, and it appears that he may have fallen from
grace. The author has created this uncertainty knowing
well that the verdict of God Himself is needed to make
clear the spiritual position and fate of His servant.</p>

<p>Besides this, Job's own suspense remains, of more
importance from a dramatic point of view. He is not
yet reconciled to providence. Those earnest cries for
light, which have gone forth passionately, pathetically
to heaven, wait for an answer. They must have some
reply, if the poet can frame a fit deliverance for the
Almighty. The task is indeed severe. On one side
there is restraint, for the original motive of the whole
action and especially the approval of Job by his Divine
Master are not to be divulged. The tried man must
not enjoy vindication at the risk of losing humility, his
victory over his friends must not be too decisive for
his own spiritual good, nor out of keeping with the
ordinary current of experience. On the other side lies
the difficulty of representing Divine wisdom in contrast
to that of man, and of dealing with the hopes and
claims of Job, for vindication, for deliverance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Sheol, for the help of a Redeemer, either in the way
of approving them or setting them definitely aside.
Urged by a necessity of his own creating, the author
has to seek a solution, and he finds one equally convincing
and modest, crowning his poem with a passage
of marvellous brilliance, aptness, and power.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked that the limitations of
genius and inspiration are distinctly visible here. The
bold prophetic hopes put into Job's mouth were beyond
the author's power to verify even to his own satisfaction.
He might himself believe in them, ardently, as
flashes of heavenly foresight, but he would not affirm
them to be Divine in their source because he could not
give adequate proof. The ideas were thrown out to
live in human thought, to find verification when God's
time came. Hence, in the speeches of the Almighty, the
ground taken is that of natural religion, the testimony
of the wonderful system of things open to the observation
of all. Is there a Divine Redeemer for the
faithful whose lives have been overshadowed? Shall
they be justified in some future state of being when
their bodies have mouldered into dust? The voice
from on high does not affirm that this shall be; the
reverence of the poet does not allow so daring an
assumption of the right to speak for God. On the
contrary, the danger of meddling with things too high
is emphasised in the very utterance which a man of
less wisdom and humility would have filled with his
own ideas. Nowhere is there a finer instance of self-denying
moderation for the sake of absolute truth.
This writer stands among men as a humble student of
the ways of God&mdash;is content to stand there at the last,
making no claim beyond the knowledge of what may
be learned from the creation and providence of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>And Job is allowed no special providence. The
voice from the storm is that which all may hear; it is
the universal revelation suited to every man. At first
sight we are disposed to agree with those who think
the appearance of the Almighty upon the scene to be
in itself strange. But there is no Theophany. There
is no revelation or message to suit a particular case,
to gratify one who thinks himself more important than
his fellow-creatures, or imagines the problem of his
life abnormally difficult. Again the wisdom of the
author goes hand in hand with his modesty; what
is within his compass he sees to be sufficient for his
end.</p>

<p>To some the utterances put into the mouth of the
Almighty may seem to come far short of the occasion.
Beginning to read the passage they may say:&mdash;Now
we are to have the fruit of the poet's most strenuous
thought, the highest inspiration. The Almighty when
He speaks in person will be made to reveal His
gracious purposes with men and the wisdom of His
government in those cases that have baffled the understanding
of Job and of all previous thinkers. Now we
shall see a new light penetrating the thick darkness
and confusion of human affairs. Since this is not done
there may be disappointment. But the author is concerned
with religion. His maxim is, "The fear of God
that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding."
He has in his drama done much for human
thought and theology. The complications which had
kept faith from resting in true spirituality on God have
been removed. The sufferer is a just man, a good man
whom God Himself has pronounced to be perfect. Job
is not afflicted because he has sinned. The author has
set in the clearest possible light all arguments he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
find for the old notion that transgression and wickedness
alone are followed by suffering in this world. He
has shown that this doctrine is not in accordance with
fact, and has made the proof so clear that a thoughtful
person could never afterwards remember the name of
Job and hold that false view. But apart from the
prologue, no explanation is given of the sufferings of
the righteous in this life. The author never says in
so many words that Job profited by his afflictions. It
might be that the righteous man, tried by loss and
pain, was established in his faith for ever, above all
possibility of doubt. But this is not affirmed. It might
be that men were purified by their sufferings, that they
found through the hot furnace a way into the noblest
life. But this is not brought forward as the ultimate
explanation. Or it might be that the good man in
affliction was the burden-bearer of others, so that his
travail and blood helped their spiritual life. But there
is no hint of this. Jehovah is to be vindicated. He
appears; He speaks out of the storm, and vindicates
Himself. Not, however, by showing the good His
servant has gained in the discipline of bereavement,
loss, and pain. It is by claiming implicit trust from
men, by showing that their wisdom at its highest is
foolishness to His, and that His administration of the
affairs of His world is in glorious faithfulness as well
as power.</p>

<p>Is it disappointing? Does the writer neglect the
great question his drama has stirred? Or has he not,
with art far more subtle than we may at first suppose,
introduced into the experience of Job a certain spiritual
gain&mdash;thoughts and hopes that widen and clear the
horizon of his life? In the depth of despondency,
just because he has been driven from every earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
comfort and stay, and can look only for miserable
death, Job sees in prophetic vision a higher hope. He
asks, "If a man die, shall he live again?" The question
remains with him and seeks an answer in the
intervals of suffering. Then at length he ventures on
the presage of a future state of existence, "whether
in the body or out of the body he cannot tell, God
knoweth,"&mdash;"My Redeemer liveth; I shall see God
for me." This prevision, this dawning of the light of
immortality upon his soul is the gain that has entered
into Job's experience. Without the despondency, the
bitterness of bereavement, the sense of decay, and the
pressure of cruel charges made against him, these
illuminating thoughts would never have come to the
sufferer; and along this line the author may have
intended to justify the afflictions of the righteous
man and quietly vindicate the dealings of God with
him.</p>

<p>If further it be asked why this is not made prominent
in the course of the Almighty's address from the storm,
an answer may be found. The hope did not remain
clear, inspiring, in the consciousness of Job. The
waves of sorrow and doubt rolled over his mind again.
It was but a flash, and like lightning at midnight it
passed and left the gloom once more. Only when by
long reflection and patient thought Job found himself
reassured in the expectation of a future life, would he
know what trouble had done for him. And it was not
in keeping with the gradual development of religious
faith that the Almighty should forestall discovery by
reviving the hope which for a time had faded. We
may take it that with rare skill the writer avoids insistence
on the value of a vision which could appear
charged with sustaining hope only after it was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
apprehended, first as a possibility, then as a revelation,
finally as a sublime truth disentangled from doubt and
error.</p>

<p>Assuming this to have been in the author's mind, we
understand why the Almighty speaking from the storm
makes no reference to the gain of affliction. There is
a return upon the original motive of the drama,&mdash;the
power of the Creator to inspire, the right of the Creator
to expect faith in Himself, whatever losses and trials
men have to endure. Neither the integrity of man nor
the claim of man upon God is first in the mind of
the author, but the majestic Godhead that gathers
to itself the adoration of the universe. Man is of
importance because he glorifies his Creator. Human
righteousness is of narrow range. It is not by his
righteousness man is saved, that is to say, finds his
true place, the development of his nature and the end
of his existence. He is redeemed from vanity and
evanescence by his faith, because in exercising it,
clinging to it through profoundest darkness, amidst
thunder and storm, when deep calleth to deep, he
enters into that wise and holy order of the universe
which God has appointed,&mdash;he lives and finds more
abundant life.</p>

<p>It is not denied that on the way toward perfect trust
in his Creator man is free to seek explanation of all
that befalls him. Our philosophy is no impertinence.
Thought must have liberty; religion must be free.
The light of justice has been kindled within us that
we may seek the answering light of the sublime justice
of God in all His dealings with ourselves and with
mankind. This is clearly before the mind of the author,
and it is the underlying idea throughout the long
colloquies between Job and his friends. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
allowed a freedom of thought and speech that sometimes
astonishes, for they are engaged in the great inquiry
which is to bring clear and uplifting knowledge of the
Creator and His will. For us it is a varied inquiry, much
of it to be conducted in pain and sorrow, on the bare
hillside or on the rough sea, in the face of peril, change
and disappointment. But if always the <i>morale</i> of life,
the fulfilment of life bestowed by God as man's trust
and inestimable possession are kept in view, freedom
is ample, and man, doing his part, need have no fear
of incurring the anger of the Divine Judge: the terrors
of low religions have no place here.</p>

<p>But now Job is given to understand that liberty has
its limitation; and the lesson is for many. To one
half of mankind, allowing the mind to lie inert or
expending it on vanities, the word has come&mdash;Inquire
what life is, what its trials mean, how the righteous
government of God is to be traced. Now, to the other
half of mankind, too adventurous in experiment and
judgment, the address of the Almighty says: Be not
too bold; far beyond your range the activities of the
Creator pass: it is not for you to understand the whole,
but always to be reverent, always to trust. The limits
of knowledge are shown, and, beyond them, the Divine
King stands in glory inaccessible, proved true and
wise and just, claiming for Himself the dutiful obedience
and adoration of His creatures. Throughout
the passage we now consider this is the strain of
argument, and the effect on Job's mind is found in his
final confession.</p>

<p>Let man remember that his main business here is
not to question but to glorify his Creator. For the time
when this book was written the truth lay here; and
here it lies even for us, and will lie for those who come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
after us. In these days it is often forgotten. Science
questions, philosophy probes into the reasons of what
has been and is, men lose themselves in labyrinths at
the far extremities of which they hope to find something
which shall make life inexpressibly great or strong or
sweet. And even theology and criticism of the Bible
occasionally fall into the same error of fancying that to
inquire and know are the main things, that although
inquiry and knowledge do not at every stage aid the
service of the Most High they may promote life. The
colloquies and controversies over, Job and his friends
are recalled to their real duty, which is to recognise
the eternal majesty and grace of the Unseen God, to
trust Him and do His will. And our experiments and
questions over in every department of knowledge, to
this we ought to come. Nay, every step in our quest
of knowledge should be taken with the desire to find
God more gloriously wise and faithful, that our obedience
may be more zealous, our worship more profound.
There are only two states of thought or dominant
methods possible when we enter on the study of the
facts of nature and providence or any research that
allures our reason. We must go forward either in the
faith of God or with the desire to establish ourselves in
knowledge, comfort and life apart from God. If the
second way is chosen, light is turned into darkness,
all discoveries prove mere apples of Sodom, and the
end is vanity. But on the other line, with life which
is good to have, with the consciousness of ability to
think and will and act, faith should begin, faith in life
and the Maker of life; and if every study is pursued
in resolute faith, man refusing to give existence itself
the lie, the mind seeking and finding new and larger
reasons for trust and service of the Creator, the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
will be that of salvation. The faults and errors of one
who follows this way will not enter into his soul to
abide there and darken it. They will be confessed
and forgiven. Such is the philosophy of the Book
of Job, and the final vindication of His servant by the
Almighty.</p>

<p class="center"><i>THE RECONCILIATION.</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Chaps.</span> xxxviii. i-xlii. 6.</p>


<p>The main argument of the address ascribed to the
Almighty is contained in chaps. xxxviii. and xxxix.,
and in the opening verses of chap. xlii. Job makes submission
and owns his fault in doubting the faithfulness
of Divine providence. The intervening passage
containing descriptions of the great animals of the Nile
is scarcely in the same high strain of poetic art or on
same high level of cogent reasoning. It seems rather
of a hyperbolical kind, suggesting failure from the clear
aim and inspiration of the previous portion.</p>

<p>The voice proceeding from the storm-cloud, in which
the Almighty veils Himself and yet makes His presence
and majesty felt, begins with a question of reproach
and a demand that the intellect of Job shall be roused
to its full vigour in order to apprehend the ensuing
argument. The closing words of Job had shown
misconception of his position before God. He spoke of
presenting a claim to Eloah and setting forth his integrity
so that his plea would be unanswerable. Circumstances
had brought upon him a stain from which he had a right
to be cleared, and, implying this, he challenged the
Divine government of the world as wanting in due
exhibition of righteousness. This being so, Job's rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
from doubt must begin with a conviction of error.
Therefore the Almighty says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Who is this darkening counsel</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>By words without knowledge?</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>For I will demand of thee and answer thou Me.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The aim of the author throughout the speech from
the storm is to provide a way of reconciliation between
man in affliction and perplexity and the providence of
God that bewilders and threatens to crush him. To
effect this something more than a demonstration of the
infinite power and wisdom of God is needed. Zophar
affirming the glory of the Almighty to be higher than
heaven, deeper than Sheol, longer than the earth,
broader than the sea, basing on this a claim that God
is unchangeably just, supplies no principle of reconciliation.
In like manner Bildad, requiring the abasement
of man as sinful and despicable in presence of the Most
High with whom are dominion and fear, shows no way
of hope and life. But the series of questions now
addressed to Job forms an argument in a higher strain,
as cogent as could be reared on the basis of that manifestation
of God which the natural world supplies. The
man is called to recognise not illimitable power only,
the eternal supremacy of the Unseen King, but also
other qualities of the Divine rule. Doubt of providence
is rebuked by a wide induction from the phenomena
of the heavens and of life upon the earth, everywhere
disclosing law and care co-operant to an end.</p>

<p>First Job is asked to think of the creation of the
world or visible universe. It is a building firmly set
on deep-laid foundations. As if by line and measure
it was brought into symmetrical form according to the
archetypal plan; and when the corner-stone was laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
as of a new palace in the great dominion of God there
was joy in heaven. The angels of the morning broke
into song, the sons of the Elohim, high in the ethereal
dwellings among the fountains of light and life, shouted
for joy. In poetic vision the writer beholds that work
of God and those rejoicing companies; but to himself,
as to Job, the question comes&mdash;What knows man of the
marvellous creative effort which he sees in imagination?
It is beyond human range. The plan and the method
are equally incomprehensible. Of this let Job be
assured&mdash;that the work was not done in vain. Not
for the creation of a world the history of which was to
pass into confusion would the morning stars have sung
together. He who beheld all that He had made and
declared it very good would not suffer triumphant evil
to confound the promise and purpose of His toil.</p>

<p>Next there is the great ocean flood, once confined as
in the womb of primæval chaos, which came forth in
living power, a giant from its birth. What can Job
tell, what can any man tell of that wonderful evolution,
when, swathed in rolling clouds and thick darkness,
with vast energy the flood of waters rushed tumultuously
to its appointed place? There is a law of use and
power for the ocean, a limit also beyond which it cannot
pass. Does man know how that is?&mdash;must he not
acknowledge the wise will and benignant care of Him
who holds in check the stormy devastating sea?</p>

<p>And who has control of the light? The morning
dawns not by the will of man. It takes hold of the
margin of the earth over which the wicked have been
ranging, and as one shakes out the dust from a sheet,
it shakes them forth visible and ashamed. Under it
the earth is changed, every object made clear and sharp
as figures on clay stamped with a seal. The forests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
fields, and rivers are seen like the embroidered or
woven designs of a garment. What is this light?
Who sends it on the mission of moral discipline? Is
not the great God who commands the dayspring to be
trusted even in the darkness? Beneath the surface
of earth is the grave and the dwelling-place of the
nether gloom. Does Job know, does any man know,
what lies beyond the gates of death? Can any tell
where the darkness has its central seat? One there
is whose is the night as well as the morning. The
mysteries of futurity, the arcana of nature lie open to
the Eternal alone.</p>

<p>Atmospheric phenomena, already often described,
reveal variously the unsearchable wisdom and thoughtful
rule of the Most High. The force that resides in
the hail, the rains that fall on the wilderness where no
man is, satisfying the waste and desolate ground and
causing the tender grass to spring up, these imply a
breadth of gracious purpose that extends beyond the
range of human life. Whose is the fatherhood of the
rain, the ice, the hoar-frost of heaven? Man is subject
to the changes these represent; he cannot control them.
And far higher are the gleaming constellations that are
set in the forehead of night. Have the hands of man
gathered the Pleiades and strung them like burning
gems on a chain of fire? Can the power of man
unloose Orion and let the stars of that magnificent
constellation wander through the sky? The Mazzaroth
or Zodiacal signs that mark the watches of the advancing
year, the Bear and the stars of her train&mdash;who leads
them forth? The laws of heaven, too, those ordinances
regulating the changes of temperature and the seasons,
does man appoint them? Is it he who brings the time
when thunderstorms break up the drought and open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
the bottles of heaven, or the time of heat "when the
dust gathers into a mass, and the clods cleave fast
together"? Without this alternation of drought and
moisture recurring by law from year to year the
labour of man would be in vain. Is not He who
governs the changing seasons to be trusted by the race
that profits most of His care?</p>

<p>At verse 39 attention is turned from inanimate
nature to the living creatures for which God provides.
With marvellous poetic skill they are painted in their
need and strength, in the urgency of their instincts,
timid or tameless or cruel. The Creator is seen rejoicing
in them as His handiwork, and man is held bound
to exult in their life and see in the provision made for
its fulfilment a guarantee of all that his own bodily
nature and spiritual being may require. Notable especially
to us is the close relation between this portion
and certain sayings of our Lord in which the same
argument brings the same conclusion. "Two passages
of God's speaking," says Mr. Ruskin, "one in
the Old and one in the New Testament, possess, it
seems to me, a different character from any of the rest,
having been uttered, the one to effect the last necessary
change in the mind of a man whose piety was in other
respects perfect; and the other as the first statement
to all men of the principles of Christianity by Christ
Himself&mdash;I mean the 38th to 41st chapters of the Book
of Job and the Sermon on the Mount. Now the first
of these passages is from beginning to end nothing else
than a direction of the mind which was to be perfected,
to humble observance of the works of God in nature.
And the other consists only in the inculcation of three
things: 1st, right conduct; 2nd, looking for eternal
life; 3rd, trusting God through watchfulness of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
dealings with His creation."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The last point is that
which brings into closest parallelism the doctrine of
Christ and that of the author of Job, and the resemblance
is not accidental, but of such a nature as to show
that both saw the underlying truth in the same way
from the same point of spiritual and human interest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When they couch in their dens</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And abide in the covert to lie in wait?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Who provideth for the raven his food,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When his young ones cry unto God</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And wander for lack of meat?</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus man is called to recognise the care of God for
creatures strong and weak, and to assure himself that
his life will not be forgotten. And in His Sermon on
the Mount our Lord says, "Behold the birds of the
heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap nor
gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth
them. Are not ye of much more value than they?"
The parallel passage in the Gospel of Luke approaches
still more closely the language in Job&mdash;"Consider the
ravens that they sow not neither reap."</p>

<p>The wild goats or goats of the rock and their young
that soon become independent of the mothers' care; the
wild asses that make their dwelling-place in the salt
land and scorn the tumult of the city; the wild ox that
cannot be tamed to go in the furrow or bring home the
sheaves in harvest; the ostrich that "leaveth her eggs
on the earth and warmeth them in the dust"; the
horse in his might, his neck clothed with the quivering
mane, mocking at fear, smelling the battle afar off; the
hawk, that soars into the blue sky; the eagle that makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
her nest on the rock,&mdash;all these, graphically described,
speak to Job of the innumerable forms of life, simple,
daring, strong and savage, that are sustained by the
power of the Creator. To think of them is to learn
that, as one among the dependants of God, man has
his part in the system of things, his assurance that the
needs God has ordained will be met. The passage is
poetically among the finest in Hebrew literature, and it
is more. In its place, with the limit the writer has set
for himself, it is most apt as a basis of reconciliation
and a new starting-point in thought for all like Job
who doubt the Divine faithfulness. Why should man,
because he can think of the providence of God, be
alone suspicious of the justice and wisdom on which all
creatures rely? Is not his power of thought given to
him that he may pass beyond the animals and praise
the Divine Provider on their behalf and his own?
Man needs more than the raven, the lion, the mountain
goat, and the eagle. He has higher instincts and
cravings. Daily food for the body will not suffice him,
nor the liberty of the wilderness. He would not be
satisfied if, like the hawk and eagle, he could soar
above the hills. His desires for righteousness, for
truth, for fulness of that spiritual life by which he is
allied to God Himself, are his distinction. So, then, He
who has created the soul will bring it to perfectness.
Where or how its longings shall be fulfilled may not
be for man to know. But he can trust God. That is
his privilege when knowledge fails. Let him lay aside
all vain thoughts and ignorant doubts. Let him say:
God is inconceivably great, unsearchably wise, infinitely
just and true; I am in His hands, and all is well.</p>

<p>The reasoning is from the less to the greater, and is
therefore in this case conclusive. The lower animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
exercise their instincts and find what is suited to their
needs. And shall it not be so with man? Shall he,
able to discern the signs of an all-embracing plan, not
confess and trust the sublime justice it reveals? The
slightness of human power is certainly contrasted with
the omnipotence of God, and the ignorance of man
with the omniscience of God; but always the Divine
faithfulness, glowing behind, shines through the veil of
nature, and it is this Job is called to recognise. Has
he almost doubted everything, because from his own
life outward to the verge of human existence wrong
and falsehood seemed to reign? But how, then, could
the countless creatures depend upon God for the satisfaction
of their desires and the fulfilment of their varied
life? Order in nature means order in the scheme of
the world as it affects humanity. And order in the
providence which controls human affairs must have for
principle fairness, justice, so that every deed
shall have due reward.</p>

<p>Such is the Divine law perceived by our inspired
author "through the things that are made." The view
of nature is still different from the scientific, but there
is certainly an approach to that reading of the universe
praised by M. Renan as peculiarly Hellenic, which
"saw the Divine in what is harmonious and evident."
Not here at least does the taunt apply that, from the
point of view of the Hebrew, "ignorance is a cult and
curiosity a wicked attempt to explain," that "even in
the presence of a mystery which assails and ruins him,
man attributes in a special manner the character of
grandeur to that which is inexplicable," that "all phenomena
whose cause is hidden, all beings whose end
cannot be perceived, are to man a humiliation and a
motive for glorifying God." The philosophy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
final portion of Job is of that kind which presses beyond
secondary causes and finds the real ground of creaturely
existence. Intellectual apprehension of the innumerable
and far-reaching threads of Divine purpose and the
secrets of the Divine will is not attempted. But the
moral nature of man is brought into touch with the
glorious righteousness of God. Thus the reconciliation
is revealed for which the whole poem has made preparation.
Job has passed through the furnace of trial
and the deep waters of doubt, and at last the way is
opened for him into a wealthy place. Till the Son of
God Himself come to clear the mystery of suffering
no larger reconciliation is possible. Accepting the
inevitable boundaries of knowledge, the mind may at
length have peace.</p>

<p>And Job finds the way of reconciliation.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I know that Thou canst do all things,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And that no purpose of Thine can be restrained.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>'Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?'</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Then have I uttered what I understood not,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i>But now mine eye seeth Thee,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Wherefore I repudiate my words and repent in dust and ashes.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All things God can do, and where His purposes are
declared there is the pledge of their accomplishment.
Does man exist?&mdash;it must be for some end that will
come about. Has God planted in the human mind
spiritual desires?&mdash;they shall be satisfied. Job returns
on the question that accused him&mdash;"Who is this
darkening counsel?" It was he himself who obscured
counsel by ignorant words. He had only heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
God then, and walked in the vain belief of a traditional
religion. His efforts to do duty and to avert the Divine
anger by sacrifice had alike sprung from the imperfect
knowledge of a dream-life that never reached beyond
words to facts and things. God was greater far than
he had ever thought, nearer than he had ever conceived.
His mind is filled with a sense of the Eternal power,
and overwhelmed by proofs of wisdom to which the
little problems of man's life can offer no difficulty.</p>

<p>"Now mine eye seeth Thee." The vision of God is
to his soul like the dazzling light of day to one issuing
from a cavern. He is in a new world where every
creature lives and moves in God. He is under a government
that appears new because now the grand comprehensiveness
and minute care of Divine providence are
realised. Doubt of God and difficulty in acknowledging
the justice of God are swept away by the magnificent
demonstration of vigour, spirit and sympathy, which
Job had as yet failed to connect with the Divine
Life. Faith therefore finds freedom, and its liberty is
reconciliation, redemption. He cannot indeed behold
God face to face and hear the judgment of acquittal for
which he had longed and cried. Of this, however,
he does not now feel the need. Rescued from the
uncertainty in which he had been involved&mdash;all that
was beautiful and good appearing to quiver like a
mirage&mdash;he feels life again to have its place and use
in the Divine order. It is the fulfilment of Job's great
hope, so far as it can be fulfilled in this world. The
question of his integrity is not formally decided. But
a larger question is answered, and the answer satisfies
meantime the personal desire.</p>

<p>Job makes no confession of sin. His friends and
Elihu, all of whom endeavour to find evil in his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
are entirely at fault. The repentance is not from
moral guilt, but from the hasty and venturous speech
that escaped him in the time of trial. After all one's
defence of Job one must allow that he does not at
every point avoid the appearance of evil. There was
need that he should repent and find new life in new
humility. The discovery he has made does not degrade
a man. Job sees God as great and true and faithful
as he had believed Him to be, yea, greater and more
faithful by far. He sees himself a creature of this
great God and is exalted, an ignorant creature and is
reproved. The larger horizon which he demanded
having opened to him, he finds himself much less than
he had seemed. In the microcosm of his past dream-life
and narrow religion he appeared great, perfect,
worthy of all he enjoyed at the hand of God; but now,
in the macrocosm, he is small, unwise, weak. God and
the soul stand sure as before; but God's justice to the
soul He has made is viewed along a different line.
Not as a mighty sheik can Job now debate with the
Almighty he has invoked. The vast ranges of being
are unfolded, and among the subjects of the Creator
he is one,&mdash;bound to praise the Almighty for existence
and all it means. His new birth is finding himself
little, yet cared for in God's great universe.</p>

<p>The writer is no doubt struggling with an idea he
cannot fully express; and in fact he gives no more
than the pictorial outline of it. But without attributing
sin to Job he points, in the confession of ignorance,
to the germ of a doctrine of sin. Man, even when
upright, must be stung to dissatisfaction, to a sense
of imperfection&mdash;to realise his fall as a new birth in
spiritual evolution. The moral ideal is indicated, the
boundlessness of duty and the need for an awakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
of man to his place in the universe. The dream-life
now appears a clouded partial existence, a period of
lost opportunities and barren vain-glory. Now opens
the greater life in the light of God.</p>

<p>And at the last the challenge of the Almighty to
Satan with which the poem began stands justified.
The Adversary cannot say,&mdash;The hedge set around
Thy servant broken down, his flesh afflicted, now he
has cursed Thee to Thy face. Out of the trial Job
comes, still on God's side, more on God's side than
ever, with a nobler faith more strongly founded on the
rock of truth. It is, we may say, a prophetic parable
of the great test to which religion is exposed in the
world, its difficulties and dangers and final triumph.
To confine the reference to Israel is to miss the grand
scope of the poem. At the last, as at the first, we
are beyond Israel, out in a universal problem of man's
nature and experience. By his wonderful gift of inspiration,
painting the sufferings and the victory of
Job, the author is a herald of the great advent. He is
one of those who prepared the way not for a Jewish
Messiah, the redeemer of a small people, but for the
Christ of God, the Son of Man, the Saviour of the
world.</p>

<p>A universal problem, that is, a question of every
human age, has been presented and within limits
brought to a solution. But it is not the supreme
question of man's life. Beneath the doubts and fears
with which this drama has dealt lie darker and more
stormy elements. The vast controversy in which every
human soul has a share oversweeps the land of Uz
and the trial of Job. From his life the conscience of
sin is excluded. The author exhibits a soul tried by
outward circumstances; he does not make his hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
share the thoughts or judgment of the evil-doer. Job
represents the believer in the furnace of providential
pain and loss. He is neither a sinner nor a sin-bearer.
Yet the book leads on with no faltering movement
toward the great drama in which every problem of
religion centres. Christ's life, character, work cover
the whole region of spiritual faith and struggle, of
conflict and reconciliation, of temptation and victory,
sin and salvation; and while the problem is exhaustively
wrought out the Reconciler stands divinely free of all
entanglement. He is light, and in Him is no darkness
at all. Job's honest life emerges at last, from a narrow
range of trial into personal reconciliation and redemption
through the grace of God. Christ's pure heavenly life
goes forward in the Spirit through the full range of
spiritual trial, bearing every need of erring man, confirming
every wistful hope of the race, yet revealing
with startling force man's immemorial quarrel with the
light, and convicting him in the hour that it saves him.
Thus for the ancient inspired drama there is set, in
the course of evolution, another, far surpassing it, the
Divine tragedy of the universe, involving the spiritual
omnipotence of God. Christ has to overcome not only
doubt and fear, but the devastating godlessness of man,
the strange sad enmity of the carnal mind. His triumph
in the sacrifice of the cross leads religion forth beyond
all difficulties and dangers into eternal purity and calm.
That is&mdash;through Him the soul of believing man is
reconciled by a transcendent spiritual law to nature
and providence, and his spirit consecrated for ever to
the holiness of the Eternal.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the sovereignty of God, as set forth
in the drama of Job with freshness and power by one
of the masters of theology, by no means covers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
whole ground of Divine action. The righteous man is
called and enabled to trust the righteousness of God;
the good man is brought to confide in that Divine
goodness which is the source of his own. But the
evil-doer remains unconstrained by grace, unmoved by
sacrifice. We have learned a broader theology, a more
strenuous yet a more gracious doctrine of the Divine
sovereignty. The induction by which we arrive at the
law is wider than nature, wider than the providence
that reveals infinite wisdom, universal equity and care.
Rightly did a great Puritan theologian take his stand
on the conviction of God as the one power in heaven
and earth and hell; rightly did he hold to the idea of
Divine will as the one sustaining energy of all energies.
But he failed just where the author of Job failed long
before: he did not fully see the correlative principle
of sovereign grace. The revelation of God in Christ,
our Sacrifice and Redeemer, vindicates with respect to
the sinful as well as the obedient the Divine act of
creation. It shows the Maker assuming responsibility
for the fallen, seeking and saving the lost; it shows
one magnificent sweep of evolution which starts from
the manifestation of God in creation and returns
through Christ to the Father, laden with the manifold
immortal gains of creative and redeeming power.</p>

<p>After the argument of the Divine voice from the
storm the epilogue is a surprise, and many have
doubted whether it is in line with the rest of the work.
Did Job need these multitudes of camels and sheep to
supplement his new faith and his reconciliation to the
Almighty will? Is there not something incongruous
in the large award of temporal good, and even something
unnecessary in the renewed honour among men?
To us it seems that a good man will be satisfied with
the favour and fellowship of a loving God. Yet, assuming
that the conclusion is a part of the history on
which the poem was founded, we can justify the blaze
of splendour that bursts on Job after sorrow, instruction
and reconciliation.</p>

<p>Life only can reward life. That great principle
was rudely shadowed forth in the old belief that God
protects His servants even to a green old age. The
poet of our book clearly apprehended the principle; it
inspired his noblest flights. Up to the closing moment
Job has lived strongly, alike in the mundane and the
moral region. How is he to find continued life? The
author's power could not pass the limits of the natural
in order to promise a reward. Not yet was it possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
even for a great thinker, to affirm that continued
fellowship with Eloah, that continued intellectual and
spiritual energy which we name eternal life. A vision
of it had come to him; he had seen the day of the
Lord afar off, but dimly, by moments. To carry a life
into it was beyond his power. Sheol made nothing
perfect; and beyond Sheol no prophet eye had ever
travelled.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, then, but to use the history
as it stood, adding symbolic touches, and show the
restored life in development on earth, more powerful
than ever, more esteemed, more richly endowed for
good action. In one point the symbolism is very
significant. Priestly office and power are given to
Job; his sacrifice and intercession mediate between the
friends who traduced him and Eloah who hears His
faithful servant's prayer. The epilogue, as a parable of
the reward of faithfulness, has deep and abiding truth.
Wider opportunity of service, more cordial esteem and
affection, the highest office that man can bear, these
are the reward of Job; and with the terms of the
symbolism we shall not quarrel who have heard the
Lord say: "Well done, thou good servant, because
thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou
authority over ten cities!"</p>

<p>Another indication of purpose must not be overlooked.
It may be said that Job's renewal in soul should
have been enough for him, that he might have spent
humbly what remained of life, at peace with men, in submission
to God. But our author was animated by the
Hebrew realism, that healthy belief in life as the gift
of God, which kept him always clear on the one hand
of Greek fatalism, on the other of Oriental asceticism.
This strong faith in life might well lead him into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
details of sons and daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren,
flocks, tribute, and years of honour.
Nor did he care at the end though any one said that
after all the Adversary was right. He had to show
expanding life as Gods recompense of faithfulness.
Satan has long ago disappeared from the drama; and
in any case the epilogue is chiefly a parable. It is,
however, a parable involving, as our Lord's parables
always involve, the sound view of man's existence,
neither that of Prometheus on the rock nor of the
grim anchorite in the Egyptian cave.</p>

<p>The writer's finest things came to him by flashes.
When he reached the close of his book he was not
able to make a tragedy and leave his readers rapt
above the world. No pre-Christian thinker could have
bound together the gleams of truth in a vision of the
spirit's undying nature and immortal youth. But Job
must find restored power and energy; and the close
had to come, as it does, in the time sphere. We can
bear to see a soul go forth naked, driven, tormented;
we can bear to see the great good life pass from the
scaffold or the fire, because we see God meeting it in
the heaven. But we have seen Christ.</p>

<p>A third point is that for dramatic completeness the
action had to bring Job to full acquittal in view of his
friends. Nothing less will satisfy the sense of poetic
justice which rules the whole work.</p>

<p>Finally, a biographical reminiscence may have given
colour to the epilogue. If, as we have supposed, the
author was once a man of substance and power in
Israel, and, reduced to poverty in the time of the
Assyrian conquest, found himself an exile in Arabia&mdash;the
wistful sense of impotence in the world must have
